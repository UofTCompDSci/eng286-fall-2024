"Extraordinary Machine"

I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes
And I certainly haven't been spreading myself around
I still only travel by foot and by foot it's a slow climb
But I'm good at being uncomfortable so
I can't stop changing all the time

I noticed that my opponent is always on the go
And won't go slow, so 's not to focus, and I notice
He'll hitch a ride with any guide, as long as
They go fast from whence he came
But he's no good at being uncomfortable, so
He can't stop staying exactly the same

If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine

I seem to you to seek a new disaster every day
You deem me due to clean my view and be at peace and lay
I mean to prove I mean to move in my own way and say
I've been getting along for long before you came into the play

I am the baby of the family, it happens
So, everybody cares and wears the sheep's clothes
While they chaperone
Curious, you looking down your nose at me, while you appease
Courteous, to try and help
But let me set your mind at ease

If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine

Do I so worry you, you need to hurry to my side?
It's very kind
But it's to no avail; and I don't want the bail
I promise you, everything will be just fine

If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine

If there was a better way to go then it would find me
I can't help it, the road just rolls out behind me
Be kind to me, or treat me mean
I'll make the most of it, I'm an extraordinary machine

"Get Him Back"

One man, he disappoint me
He give me the gouge and he take my glee
Now every other man I see
Remind me of the one man who disappointed me

Wait 'til I get him back
He won't have a back to scratch
Yeah, keep turning that chin
And you will see my face
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch

So I say, and on I go
To another one who disappoint me so

Next one up, a contemptible snob
He lived to put things in their place
He did a commendable job
He put himself so low
He can hardly even look me in the face

So wait 'til I get him back
He won't have a back to scratch
Yeah, keep turning that chin
And you will see my face
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch

Oh, he made my blood just burn
I flipped so far, I thought that I would not return

But the last one I had who was getting my hopes up
I might've been a little fast to dismiss
I think he let me down, when he didn't disappoint me
He didn't always guess right, but he usually got my gist

So wait 'til I get him back
I'm gonna bring him home and I'll watch him unpack
Yeah, keep turning that chin
And you will see my face is fixed on the one
I'm gonna get back

I'm gonna get him back, I am
I'm gonna get him back
I really am
I'm gonna get him back
I'm gonna get him back
I am, I'm gonna get him back, oh yeah
"O' Sailor"

I'm undecided about you again
Mightn't be right that you're not here
It's double-sided 'cause I ruined it all
But also saved myself
By never believing you, dear

Everything good I deem too good to be true
Everything else is just a bore
Everything I have to look forward to
Has a pretty painful and very imposing before

O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards

I have too been playing with fifty-two cards
Just 'cause I play so far from my vest
Whatever I've got, I've got no reason to guard
What could I do but spend my best

O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards

And after waiting, fighting patiently on my knees
All the other stuff tired itself out first, not me
And in its wake appeared the touch and call of a different breed
One who set to get me wise and got me there and then, got me

And what a thing to know what could be instead
Oh what a blessed curse to see
It took the agenda from its place in my bed
Made a merry paramour of me

O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Giving me eyes to view it
As it goes by the boards

O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Saying there's nothing to it
And then lettin' it go by the boards

O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Giving me eyes to view it
As it goes by the boards
O' sailor why'd you do it
What'd you do that for
Giving me eyes to view it
As it goes by the boards

"Better Version Of Me"

The nickel dropped when I was on
My way beyond the Rubicon
What did I do?
And of the games that I can handle
None are ones worth the candle
What should I do?
I'm a frightened, fickle person
Fighting, cryin', kickin', cursin'
What should I do?

Ooh, after all the folderol
And hauling over coals stops
What will I do?

Can't take a good day without a bad one
Don't feel just to smile until I've had one
Where did I learn?
I make a fuss about a little thing
The rhyme is losing to the riddling
Where's the turn?
I don't want a home, I'd ruin that
Home is where my habits have a habitat
Why give it a turn?

Ooh, after all the folderol
And hauling over coals stops
What did I learn?

I am likely to miss the main event
If I stop to cry or complain again
So I will keep a deliberate pace
Let the damned breeze dry my face

Ooh mister wait until you see
What I'm gonna be

I've got a plan, a demand and it just began
And if you're right, you'll agree
Here's coming a better version of me

Here it comes, a better version of me
Here it comes, a better version of me

"Tymps (The Sick In The Head Song)"

Those boon times went bust, my feet of clay, they dried to dust
The red isn't the red we painted, it's just rust
And that signature thing that used to bring a following
I have trouble now even remembering

So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night?
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head, I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him, I sure hope that's it

I knew that to keep in touch, would do me deep in dutch
'Cause it isn't the rush of remembering, it's just mush
And that signature thing is only growing harrowing
I should have no trouble now to keep from following

So why did I kiss him so hard late last Friday night?
And keep on letting him change all my plans
I'm either so sick in the head, I need to be bled dry to quit
Or I just really used to love him, I sure hope that's it

"Parting Gift"

I opened my eyes
While you were kissing me once more than once
And you looked as sincere as a dog
Just as sincere as a dog does
When it's the food on your lips with which it's in love

I bet you could never tell
That I knew you didn't know me that well
It is my fault you see
You never learned that much from me

Oh you silly stupid pastime of mine
You were always good for a rhyme
And from the first, to the last time, the signs
Said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started
It said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started

I took off my glasses
While you were yelling at me once more than once
So as not to see you see me react
Should've put 'em, should've put 'em on again
So I could see you see me sincerely yelling back

I bet your fortress face
Belied your fort of lace
It is by the grace of me
You never learned what I could see

Oh you silly stupid pastime of mine
You were always good for a rhyme
And from the first to all the last times, all the signs
Said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started
It said 'Stop' - but we went on whole-hearted
It ended bad, but I love what we started

"Window"

I was staring out the window
The whole time he was talking to me
It was a filthy pane of glass
I couldn't get a clear view
And as he went on and on
It wasn't the outside world I could see
Just the filthy pane that I was looking through

So I had to break the window
It just had to be
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me

I was never focused on just one thing
My eyes got fixed when my mind got so
It may look like I'm concentrated on
A very clear view
But I'm as good as asleep
I bet you didn't know
It'd take a lot of it away
If you do

I had to break the window
It just had to be
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than forget what I had to say
Or miss what I should see

Because the fact being that
Whatever's in front of me
Is covering my view
So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact
I only see what I'm looking through

So again I've done the right thing
I was never worried about that
The answer's always been in clear view
But even when the window was cleaned
I still can't see for the fact
That when it's clean
It's so clear I can't tell what I'm looking through

So I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than him or her or me
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than miss what I should see
I had to break the window
It just had to be
It was in my way
Better that I break the window
Than forget what I had to say
Or miss what I should see
Or break him or her or me
Especially me

"Oh Well"

What you did to me made me see myself
Something different
And though I try to talk sense to myself
But I just won't listen

Won't you go away, turn yourself in
You're no good at confession
Before the image that you burned me in
Tries to teach you a lesson

What you did to me made me see myself
Something awful
A voice once stentorian is now again
Meek and muffled

It took me such a long time to get back up
The first time you did it
I spent all I had to get it back, and now it seems
I've been out-bidded

My peace and quiet was stolen from me
When I was looking with calm affection
You were searching out my imperfections
What wasted unconditional love
On somebody
Who doesn't believe in the stuff

You came upon me like a hypnic jerk
When I was just about settled
And when it counts, you recoil with a cryptic word
And leave a love belittled

Oh what a cold and common old way to go
When I was feeding on the need for you to know me
Devastated at the rate you fell below me
What wasted unconditional love
On somebody
Who doesn't believe in the stuff
Oh, well

"Please Please Please"

Please, please, please
No more melodies
They lack impact, they're petty
They've been made up already
Please, please, please
No more maladies
I'm so tired of crying
You'd think I was a siren
But me and everybody's on the sad same team
And you can hear our sad brains screaming

Give us something familiar
Something similar
To what we know already
That will keep us steady
Steady
Steady going nowhere

Please, please, please
No apologies
At best they buy you time
Until you next step out of line
Please, please, please
No more remedies
My method is uncertain
It's a mess but it's working
And maybe if you wanna try it out
You won't like it so when you're crying out

Give us something familiar
Something similar
To what we know already
That will keep us steady
Steady
Steady going nowhere

Please, please, please
No more melodies
They lack impact, they're petty
They've been made up already
Please, please, please
No more maladies

I don't understand about complementary colors
And what they say
Side by side they both get bright
Together, they both get gray

But he's been pretty much yellow
And I've been kind of blue
But all I can see is
Red, red, red, red, red
Now, what am I gonna do?

I don't understand about diamonds
And why men buy them
What's so impressive about a diamond
Except the mining?

But it's dangerous work
Trying to get to you, too
And I think if I didn't have to kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill myself doing it
Maybe I wouldn't think so much of you


I've been watchin' all the time
And I still can't find the tack
But I wanna know is, is it okay? Is it just fine?
Or is it my fault?
Is it my lack?


I don't understand about
The weather outside
Or the harmony in a tune
Or why somebody lied

But there's solace a bit in submittin'
To the fitfully, cryptically true
What's happened, has happened
What's comin' is already on its way
With a role for me to play
And I don't understand, I never understand
But I'll try to understand
There's nothing else I can do

The early cars already are
Drawing deep breaths past my door
And last night's phrases, sick with lack of basis
Are still writhing on my floor


And it doesn't seem fair
That your wicked words should work in holding me down
No, it doesn't seem right
To take information given at close range
For the gag and the bind and the ammunition round

Conversation, once colored by esteem
Became dialogue as a diagram of a play for blood
Took a vacation; my palate got clean
Now I can taste your agenda while you're spitting your cud

And it doesn't make sense
I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown
It doesn't seem right
To take information given at close range
For the gag and the bind and the ammunition round

This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache

"What is this posture I have to stare at"
That's what he said when I was sitting up straight
Changed the name of the game 'cause he lost it
He knew he was wrong, but he knew it too late
But I'm not being fair 'cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth
But I'd like to choose right
Take all the things that I said that he stole
Put 'em in a sack, swing 'em over my shoulder
Turn on my heels, step out of his sight
Try to live in a lovelier light

This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
This is not about love
'Cause I am not in love
In fact, I can't stop falling out
I miss that stupid ache

If you don't have a song to sing, you're okay
You know how to get along humming
Hmm, hmm


If you don't have a date, celebrate
Go out and sit on the lawn and do nothing
'Cause it's just what you must do and nobody does it anymore


No, I don't believe in the wasting of time
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine


If you don't have a point to make, don't sweat it
You'll make a sharp one bein' so kind
And I'd sure appreciate it
Everyone else's goal's to get big-headed
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm
Better than fine?


Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
