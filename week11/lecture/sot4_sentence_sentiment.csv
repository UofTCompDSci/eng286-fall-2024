Chapter I The Science of Deduction Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantel-piece and his hypodermic syringe from its neat morocco case,0.0,0.0
With his long white nervous fingers he adjusted the delicate needle and rolled back his left shirt-cuff,-0.06999999999999999,0.26
For some little time his eyes rested thoughtfully upon the sinewy forearm and wrist all dotted and scarred with innumerable puncture-marks,0.10625000000000001,0.5
Finally he thrust the sharp point home pressed down the tiny piston and sank back into the velvet-lined arm-chair with a long sigh of satisfaction,-0.05509259259259259,0.48981481481481476
Three times a day for many months I had witnessed this performance but custom had not reconciled my mind to it,0.5,0.5
On the contrary from day to day I had become more irritable at the sight and my conscience swelled nightly within me at the thought that I had lacked the courage to protest,0.5,0.5
Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject but there was that in the cool nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty,0.04583333333333333,0.2625
His great powers his masterly manner and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities all made me diffident and backward in crossing him,0.35833333333333334,0.7625
Yet upon that afternoon whether it was the Beaune which I had taken with my lunch or the additional exasperation produced by the extreme deliberation of his manner I suddenly felt that I could hold out no longer,-0.0625,0.75
“ Which is it to-day ” I asked — “ morphine or cocaine ” He raised his eyes languidly from the old black-letter volume which he had opened,0.1,0.2
“ It is cocaine ” he said — “ a seven-per-cent,0.0,0.0

“ Perhaps you are right Watson ” he said,0.2857142857142857,0.5357142857142857
“ I suppose that its influence is physically a bad one,-0.6999999999999998,0.6666666666666666
I find it however so transcendently stimulating and clarifying to the mind that its secondary action is a matter of small moment ” “ But consider ” I said earnestly,-0.1708333333333333,0.26666666666666666

Remember that I speak not only as one comrade to another but as a medical man to one for whose constitution he is to some extent answerable ” He did not seem offended,0.0,0.5
On the contrary he put his finger-tips together and leaned his elbows on the arms of his chair like one who has a relish for conversation,0.0,0.0
“ My mind ” he said “ rebels at stagnation,0.0,0.0
Give me problems give me work give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis and I am in my own proper atmosphere,0.4,0.525
I can dispense then with artificial stimulants,-0.6,1.0
But I abhor the dull routine of existence,-0.2916666666666667,0.5
I crave for mental exaltation,-0.1,0.2
That is why I have chosen my own particular profession —or rather created it for I am the only one in the world ” “ The only unofficial detective ” I said raising my eyebrows,0.19166666666666665,0.8333333333333333

But you have yourself had some experience of my methods of work in the Jefferson Hope case ” “ Yes indeed ” said I cordially,0.0,0.0
“ I was never so struck by anything in my life,0.0,0.0
I even embodied it in a small brochure with the somewhat fantastic title of ‘ A Study in Scarlet ’ ” He shook his head sadly,-0.11666666666666665,0.7666666666666666
“ I glanced over it ” said he,0.0,0.0
“ Honestly I can not congratulate you upon it,0.6,0.9

You have attempted to tinge it with romanticism which produces much the same effect as if you worked a love-story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of Euclid ” “ But the romance was there ” I remonstrated,0.1,0.1625
“ I could not tamper with the facts ” “ Some facts should be suppressed or at least a just sense of proportion should be observed in treating them,-0.3,0.4
The only point in the case which deserved mention was the curious analytical reasoning from effects to causes by which I succeeded in unraveling it ” I was annoyed at this criticism of a work which had been specially designed to please him,-0.03571428571428571,0.8428571428571427
I confess too that I was irritated by the egotism which seemed to demand that every line of my pamphlet should be devoted to his own special doings,0.47857142857142854,0.7857142857142857
More than once during the years that I had lived with him in Baker Street I had observed that a small vanity underlay my companion ’ s quiet and didactic manner,-0.0625,0.5083333333333333
I made no remark however but sat nursing my wounded leg,0.0,0.0

“ My practice has extended recently to the Continent ” said Holmes after a while filling up his old brier-root pipe,0.05,0.225
“ I was consulted last week by François Le Villard who as you probably know has come rather to the front lately in the French detective service,-0.09999999999999999,0.2222222222222222
He has all the Celtic power of quick intuition but he is deficient in the wide range of exact knowledge which is essential to the higher developments of his art,0.055555555555555546,0.44166666666666665
The case was concerned with a will and possessed some features of interest,0.0,0.0
I was able to refer him to two parallel cases the one at Riga in 1857 and the other at St Louis in 1871 which have suggested to him the true solution,0.18125,0.4125
Here is the letter which I had this morning acknowledging my assistance ” He tossed over as he spoke a crumpled sheet of foreign notepaper,-0.125,0.125
I glanced my eyes down it catching a profusion of notes of admiration with stray “ magnifiques ” “ coup-de-maîtres ” and “ tours-de-force ” all testifying to the ardent admiration of the Frenchman,0.2222222222222222,0.5944444444444444
“ He speaks as a pupil to his master ” said I,0.0,0.0
“ Oh he rates my assistance too highly ” said Sherlock Holmes lightly,0.28,0.6199999999999999
“ He has considerable gifts himself,0.1,0.45
He possesses two out of the three qualities necessary for the ideal detective,0.45,1.0
He has the power of observation and that of deduction,0.0,0.0
He is only wanting in knowledge and that may come in time,0.0,1.0
He is now translating my small works into French ” “ Your works ” “ Oh didn ’ t you know ” he cried laughing,-0.125,0.2
“ Yes I have been guilty of several monographs,-0.25,0.5
They are all upon technical subjects,0.0,0.1
Here for example is one ‘ Upon the Distinction between the Ashes of the Various Tobaccoes ’ In it I enumerate a hundred and forty forms of cigar cigarette and pipe-tobacco with coloured plates illustrating the difference in the ash,0.0,0.5
It is a point which is continually turning up in criminal trials and which is sometimes of supreme importance as a clue,-0.4,0.55
If you can say definitely for example that some murder has been done by a man who was smoking an Indian lunkah it obviously narrows your field of search,0.0,0.5
To the trained eye there is as much difference between the black ash of a Trichinopoly and the white fluff of bird ’ s-eye as there is between a cabbage and a potato ” “ You have an extraordinary genius for minutiæ ” I remarked,0.05333333333333333,0.38666666666666666
“ I appreciate their importance,0.0,0.0
Here is my monograph upon the tracing of footsteps with some remarks upon the uses of plaster of Paris as a preserver of impresses,0.0,0.0
Here too is a curious little work upon the influence of a trade upon the form of the hand with lithotypes of the hands of slaters sailors corkcutters compositors weavers and diamond-polishers,-0.14375,0.75
That is a matter of great practical interest to the scientific detective —especially in cases of unclaimed bodies or in discovering the antecedents of criminals,0.8,0.75
But I weary you with my hobby ” “ Not at all ” I answered earnestly,0.0,0.0
“ It is of the greatest interest to me especially since I have had the opportunity of observing your practical application of it,0.5,1.0
But you spoke just now of observation and deduction,0.0,0.0
Surely the one to some extent implies the other ” “ Why hardly ” he answered leaning back luxuriously in his arm-chair and sending up thick blue wreaths from his pipe,-0.03611111111111112,0.39675925925925926
“ For example observation shows me that you have been to the Wigmore Street Post-Office this morning but deduction lets me know that when there you dispatched a telegram ” “ Right ” said I,0.3571428571428571,0.5357142857142857
“ Right on both points,0.3571428571428571,0.5357142857142857
But I confess that I don ’ t see how you arrived at it,0.0,0.0
It was a sudden impulse upon my part and I have mentioned it to no one ” “ It is simplicity itself ” he remarked chuckling at my surprise — “ so absurdly simple that an explanation is superfluous and yet it may serve to define the limits of observation and of deduction,0.0,0.4285714285714286
Observation tells me that you have a little reddish mould adhering to your instep,-0.1875,0.5
Just opposite the Wigmore Street Office they have taken up the pavement and thrown up some earth which lies in such a way that it is difficult to avoid treading in it in entering,-0.16666666666666666,0.5
The earth is of this peculiar reddish tint which is found as far as I know nowhere else in the neighbourhood,0.1,1.0
So much is observation,0.2,0.2
The rest is deduction ” “ How then did you deduce the telegram ” “ Why of course I knew that you had not written a letter since I sat opposite to you all morning,0.0,0.0
I see also in your open desk there that you have a sheet of stamps and a thick bundle of post-cards,-0.15000000000000002,0.4875
What could you go into the post-office for then but to send a wire,0.0,0.0
Eliminate all other factors and the one which remains must be the truth ” “ In this case it certainly is so ” I replied after a little thought,-0.03273809523809524,0.48214285714285715
“ The thing however is as you say of the simplest,0.0,0.0
Would you think me impertinent if I were to put your theories to a more severe test ” “ On the contrary ” he answered “ it would prevent me from taking a second dose of cocaine,0.25,0.25
I should be delighted to look into any problem which you might submit to me ” “ I have heard you say that it is difficult for a man to have any object in daily use without leaving the impress of his individuality upon it in such a way that a trained observer might read it,0.04999999999999999,0.55
Now I have here a watch which has recently come into my possession,0.0,0.25
Would you have the kindness to let me have an opinion upon the character or habits of the late owner ” I handed him over the watch with some slight feeling of amusement in my heart for the test was as I thought an impossible one and I intended it as a lesson against the somewhat dogmatic tone which he occasionally assumed,-0.2833333333333333,0.47291666666666665
He balanced the watch in his hand gazed hard at the dial opened the back and examined the works first with his naked eyes and then with a powerful convex lens,0.07638888888888888,0.4791666666666667
I could hardly keep from smiling at his crestfallen face when he finally snapped the case to and handed it back,-0.09722222222222222,0.5138888888888888
“ There are hardly any data ” he remarked,-0.2916666666666667,0.5416666666666666
“ The watch has been recently cleaned which robs me of my most suggestive facts ” “ You are right ” I answered,0.2619047619047619,0.42857142857142855
“ It was cleaned before being sent to me ” In my heart I accused my companion of putting forward a most lame and impotent excuse to cover his failure,-0.09166666666666667,0.4
What data could he expect from an uncleaned watch,0.0,0.0
“ Though unsatisfactory my research has not been entirely barren ” he observed staring up at the ceiling with dreamy lack-lustre eyes,0.0,0.625
“ Subject to your correction I should judge that the watch belonged to your elder brother who inherited it from your father ” “ That you gather no doubt from the H W upon the back ” “ Quite so,-0.08333333333333333,0.16666666666666666
The W suggests your own name,0.6,1.0
The date of the watch is nearly fifty years back and the initials are as old as the watch so it was made for the last generation,0.05,0.16666666666666669
Jewelry usually descends to the eldest son and he is most likely to have the same name as the father,0.0625,0.46875
Your father has if I remember right been dead many years,0.1952380952380952,0.4785714285714286
It has therefore been in the hands of your eldest brother ” “ Right so far ” said I,0.19285714285714284,0.7678571428571428
“ Anything else ” “ He was a man of untidy habits —very untidy and careless,-0.5,0.9
He was left with good prospects but he threw away his chances lived for some time in poverty with occasional short intervals of prosperity and finally taking to drink he died,0.13999999999999999,0.4050000000000001
That is all I can gather ” I sprang from my chair and limped impatiently about the room with considerable bitterness in my heart,-0.05,0.675
“ This is unworthy of you Holmes ” I said,0.0,0.0
“ I could not have believed that you would have descended to this,0.0,0.0
You have made inquires into the history of my unhappy brother and you now pretend to deduce this knowledge in some fanciful way,-0.6,0.9
You can not expect me to believe that you have read all this from his old watch,0.125,0.2
It is unkind and to speak plainly has a touch of charlatanism in it ” “ My dear doctor ” said he kindly “ pray accept my apologies,0.19285714285714284,0.6285714285714286
Viewing the matter as an abstract problem I had forgotten how personal and painful a thing it might be to you,-0.35,0.6
I assure you however that I never even knew that you had a brother until you handed me the watch ” “ Then how in the name of all that is wonderful did you get these facts,1.0,1.0
They are absolutely correct in every particular ” “ Ah that is good luck,0.35555555555555557,0.6111111111111112
I could only say what was the balance of probability,0.0,1.0
I did not at all expect to be so accurate ” “ But it was not mere guess-work ” “ No no I never guess,0.32500000000000007,0.5666666666666667
It is a shocking habit —destructive to the logical faculty,-0.375,0.625
What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought or observe the small facts upon which large inferences may depend,-0.02142857142857143,0.4946428571428571
For example I began by stating that your brother was careless,-0.5,0.9
When you observe the lower part of that watch-case you notice that it is not only dinted in two places but it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard objects such as coins or keys in the same pocket,-0.05277777777777778,0.5236111111111111
Surely it is no great feat to assume that a man who treats a fifty-guinea watch so cavalierly must be a careless man,-0.45,0.825
Neither is it a very far-fetched inference that a man who inherits one article of such value is pretty well provided for in other respects ” I nodded to show that I followed his reasoning,0.08125,0.54375
“ It is very customary for pawnbrokers in England when they take a watch to scratch the number of the ticket with a pin-point upon the inside of the case,0.2,0.3
It is more handy than a label as there is no risk of the number being lost or transposed,0.55,0.7
There are no less than four such numbers visible to my lens on the inside of this case,0.041666666666666664,0.2833333333333333
Inference —that your brother was often at low water,0.0,0.3
Secondary inference —that he had occasional bursts of prosperity or he could not have redeemed the pledge,-0.15,0.2125
Finally I ask you to look at the inner plate which contains the key-hole,0.0,0.5833333333333334
Look at the thousands of scratches all round the hole —marks where the key has slipped,-0.1,0.7
What sober man ’ s key could have scored those grooves,0.05,0.6
But you will never see a drunkard ’ s watch without them,0.0,0.0
He winds it at night and he leaves these traces of his unsteady hand,0.0,0.0
Where is the mystery in all this ” “ It is as clear as daylight ” I answered,0.10000000000000002,0.3833333333333333
“ I regret the injustice which I did you,0.0,0.0
I should have had more faith in your marvellous faculty,0.5,0.5
May I ask whether you have any professional inquiry on foot at present ” “ None,0.05,0.05

What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material,0.5,0.5
What is the use of having powers doctor when one has no field upon which to exert them,0.0,0.0
Crime is commonplace existence is commonplace and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth ” I had opened my mouth to reply to this tirade when with a crisp knock our landlady entered bearing a card upon the brass salver,0.25,0.4166666666666667
“ A young lady for you sir ” she said addressing my companion,0.1,0.4
“ Miss Mary Morstan ” he read,0.0,0.0

I should prefer that you remain ” Chapter II The Statement of the Case Miss Morstan entered the room with a firm step and an outward composure of manner,-0.2,0.4
She was a blonde young lady small dainty well gloved and dressed in the most perfect taste,0.375,0.5499999999999999
There was however a plainness and simplicity about her costume which bore with it a suggestion of limited means,-0.07142857142857142,0.14285714285714285
The dress was a sombre greyish beige untrimmed and unbraided and she wore a small turban of the same dull hue relieved only by a suspicion of white feather in the side,-0.10833333333333335,0.40499999999999997
Her face had neither regularity of feature nor beauty of complexion but her expression was sweet and amiable and her large blue eyes were singularly spiritual and sympathetic,0.21285714285714286,0.46238095238095234
In an experience of women which extends over many nations and three separate continents I have never looked upon a face which gave a clearer promise of a refined and sensitive nature,0.3,0.7
I could not but observe that as she took the seat which Sherlock Holmes placed for her her lip trembled her hand quivered and she showed every sign of intense inward agitation,0.2,1.0
“ I have come to you Mr Holmes ” she said “ because you once enabled my employer Mrs Cecil Forrester to unravel a little domestic complication,-0.09375,0.3
She was much impressed by your kindness and skill ” “ Mrs,1.0,1.0
Cecil Forrester ” he repeated thoughtfully,0.4,0.5
“ I believe that I was of some slight service to her,-0.16666666666666666,0.16666666666666666
The case however as I remember it was a very simple one ” “ She did not think so,0.0,0.4642857142857143
But at least you can not say the same of mine,-0.15,0.2625
I can hardly imagine anything more strange more utterly inexplicable than the situation in which I find myself ” Holmes rubbed his hands and his eyes glistened,0.011666666666666669,0.5183333333333333
He leaned forward in his chair with an expression of extraordinary concentration upon his clear-cut hawklike features,0.3333333333333333,1.0
“ State your case ” said he in brisk business tones,0.0,0.0
I felt that my position was an embarrassing one,0.0,0.0
“ You will I am sure excuse me ” I said rising from my chair,0.225,0.46944444444444444
To my surprise the young lady held up her gloved hand to detain me,0.1,0.4
“ If your friend ” she said “ would be good enough to stop he might be of inestimable service to me ” I relapsed into my chair,0.35,0.55
“ Briefly ” she continued “ the facts are these,0.0,0.3333333333333333
My father was an officer in an Indian regiment who sent me home when I was quite a child,0.0,0.0
My mother was dead and I had no relative in England,-0.1,0.2
I was placed however in a comfortable boarding establishment at Edinburgh and there I remained until I was seventeen years of age,0.4,0.8
In the year 1878 my father who was senior captain of his regiment obtained twelve months ’ leave and came home,0.0,0.0
He telegraphed to me from London that he had arrived all safe and directed me to come down at once giving the Langham Hotel as his address,0.17222222222222222,0.3944444444444445
His message as I remember was full of kindness and love,0.425,0.575
On reaching London I drove to the Langham and was informed that Captain Morstan was staying there but that he had gone out the night before and had not yet returned,0.0,0.0
I waited all day without news of him,0.0,0.0
That night on the advice of the manager of the hotel I communicated with the police and next morning we advertised in all the papers,0.0,0.0
Our inquiries led to no result and from that day to this no word has ever been heard of my unfortunate father,-0.5,1.0
He came home with his heart full of hope to find some peace some comfort and instead— ” She put her hand to her throat and a choking sob cut short the sentence,0.175,0.42500000000000004

There was nothing in it to suggest a clue —some clothes some books and a considerable number of curiosities from the Andaman Islands,0.1,0.45
He had been one of the officers in charge of the convict-guard there ” “ Had he any friends in town ” “ Only one that we know of —Major Sholto of his own regiment the 34th Bombay Infantry,0.3,1.0
The major had retired some little time before and lived at Upper Norwood,-0.041666666666666664,0.3333333333333333
We communicated with him of course but he did not even know that his brother officer was in England ” “ A singular case ” remarked Holmes,0.0,0.0
“ I have not yet described to you the most singular part,0.5,0.5
About six years ago—to be exact upon the 4th of May 1882—an advertisement appeared in the Times asking for the address of Miss Mary Morstan and stating that it would be to her advantage to come forward,0.25,0.25

Let me recommend this book —one of the most remarkable ever penned,0.625,0.625
It is Winwood Reade ’ s ‘ Martyrdom of Man ’ I shall be back in an hour ” I sat in the window with the volume in my hand but my thoughts were far from the daring speculations of the writer,0.05,0.5
My mind ran upon our late visitor —her smiles the deep rich tones of her voice the strange mystery which overhung her life,0.006250000000000002,0.475
If she were seventeen at the time of her father ’ s disappearance she must be seven-and-twenty now —a sweet age when youth has lost its self-consciousness and become a little sobered by experience,0.08124999999999999,0.575
So I sat and mused until such dangerous thoughts came into my head that I hurried away to my desk and plunged furiously into the latest treatise upon pathology,-0.033333333333333326,0.7666666666666666
What was I an army surgeon with a weak leg and a weaker banking-account that I should dare to think of such things,-0.1875,0.5625
She was a unit a factor —nothing more,0.5,0.5
If my future were black it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o ’ the-wisps of the imagination,0.06666666666666668,0.4894444444444444
Chapter III In Quest of a Solution It was half-past five before Holmes returned,0.0,0.0
He was bright eager and in excellent spirits —a mood which in his case alternated with fits of the blackest depression,0.8500000000000001,0.8999999999999999
“ There is no great mystery in this matter ” he said taking the cup of tea which I had poured out for him,-0.4,0.75
“ The facts appear to admit of only one explanation ” “ What,0.0,1.0
you have solved it already ” “ Well that would be too much to say,0.2,0.2
I have discovered a suggestive fact that is all,0.0,0.0
It is however very suggestive,0.2,0.3
The details are still to be added,0.0,0.0
I have just found on consulting the back files of the Times that Major Sholto of Upper Norword late of the 34th Bombay Infantry died upon the 28th of April 1882 ” “ I may be very obtuse Holmes but I fail to see what this suggests ” “ No,-0.08958333333333333,0.2833333333333334
You surprise me,0.0,0.0
Look at it in this way then,0.0,0.0
Captain Morstan disappears,0.0,0.0
The only person in London whom he could have visited is Major Sholto,0.03125,0.75
Major Sholto denies having heard that he was in London,0.0625,0.5
Four years later Sholto dies,0.0,0.0
Within a week of his death Captain Morstan ’ s daughter receives a valuable present which is repeated from year to year and now culminates in a letter which describes her as a wronged woman,0.0,0.0
What wrong can it refer to except this deprivation of her father,-0.5,0.9
And why should the presents begin immediately after Sholto ’ s death unless it is that Sholto ’ s heir knows something of the mystery and desires to make compensation,0.0,0.0
Have you any alternative theory which will meet the facts ” “ But what a strange compensation,-0.0625,0.15
And how strangely made,-0.0625,0.15
Why too should he write a letter now rather than six years ago,0.0,0.0
Again the letter speaks of giving her justice,0.0,0.0
What justice can she have,0.0,0.0
It is too much to suppose that her father is still alive,0.15000000000000002,0.30000000000000004
There is no other injustice in her case that you know of ” “ There are difficulties there are certainly difficulties ” said Sherlock Holmes pensively,0.13839285714285715,0.4732142857142857
“ But our expedition of to-night will solve them all,0.0,0.0
Ah here is a four-wheeler and Miss Morstan is inside,0.0,0.0
Are you all ready,0.2,0.5
Then we had better go down for it is a little past the hour ” I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick but I observed that Holmes took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket,-0.02326388888888889,0.38472222222222224
It was clear that he thought that our night ’ s work might be a serious one,-0.11666666666666664,0.5249999999999999
Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak and her sensitive face was composed but pale,-0.08666666666666667,0.49333333333333335
She must have been more than woman if she did not feel some uneasiness at the strange enterprise upon which we were embarking yet her self-control was perfect and she readily answered the few additional questions which Sherlock Holmes put to her,0.29,0.45
“ Major Sholto was a very particular friend of papa ’ s ” she said,0.13958333333333334,0.4666666666666667
“ His letters were full of allusions to the major,0.10416666666666667,0.3833333333333333
He and papa were in command of the troops at the Andaman Islands so they were thrown a great deal together,0.8,0.75
By the way a curious paper was found in papa ’ s desk which no one could understand,-0.1,1.0
I don ’ t suppose that it is of the slightest importance but I thought you might care to see it so I brought it with me,0.0,0.0
It is here ” Holmes unfolded the paper carefully and smoothed it out upon his knee,-0.1,1.0
He then very methodically examined it all over with his double lens,0.1,0.15
“ It is paper of native Indian manufacture ” he remarked,0.0,0.0
“ It has at some time been pinned to a board,0.0,0.0
The diagram upon it appears to be a plan of part of a large building with numerous halls corridors and passages,0.10714285714285714,0.4642857142857143
At one point is a small cross done in red ink and above it is ‘ 3.37 from left ’ in faded pencil-writing,-0.05,0.1
In the left-hand corner is a curious hieroglyphic like four crosses in a line with their arms touching,0.2,0.75
Beside it is written in very rough and coarse characters ‘ The sign of the four —Jonathan Small Mahomet Singh Abdullah Khan Dost Akbar ’ No I confess that I do not see how this bears upon the matter,-0.12666666666666668,0.47333333333333333
Yet it is evidently a document of importance,0.25,0.25
It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book for the one side is as clean as the other ” “ It was in his pocket-book that we found it ” “ Preserve it carefully then Miss Morstan for it may prove to be of use to us,0.010416666666666678,0.76875
I begin to suspect that this matter may turn out to be much deeper and more subtle than I at first supposed,0.15416666666666667,0.3833333333333333
I must reconsider my ideas ” He leaned back in the cab and I could see by his drawn brow and his vacant eye that he was thinking intently,0.0,0.0
Miss Morstan and I chatted in an undertone about our present expedition and its possible outcome but our companion maintained his impenetrable reserve until the end of our journey,0.0,0.5
It was a September evening and not yet seven o ’ clock but the day had been a dreary one and a dense drizzly fog lay low upon the great city,0.4,0.525
Mud-coloured clouds drooped sadly over the muddy streets,-0.5,1.0
Down the Strand the lamps were but misty splotches of diffused light which threw a feeble circular glimmer upon the slimy pavement,-0.08518518518518518,0.662962962962963
The yellow glare from the shop-windows streamed out into the steamy vaporous air and threw a murky shifting radiance across the crowded thoroughfare,0.0,0.0
There was to my mind something eerie and ghost-like in the endless procession of faces which flitted across these narrow bars of light —sad faces and glad haggard and merry,-0.08124999999999999,0.7875
Like all human kind they flitted from the gloom into the light and so back into the gloom once more,0.1761904761904762,0.3523809523809524
I am not subject to impressions but the dull heavy evening with the strange business upon which we were engaged combined to make me nervous and depressed,-0.11458333333333334,0.3708333333333333
I could see from Miss Morstan ’ s manner that she was suffering from the same feeling,0.0,0.125
Holmes alone could rise superior to petty influences,0.7,0.9
He held his open note-book upon his knee and from time to time he jotted down figures and memoranda in the light of his pocket-lantern,0.08148148148148147,0.4962962962962963
At the Lyceum Theatre the crowds were already thick at the side-entrances,-0.30000000000000004,0.475

We had hardly reached the third pillar which was our rendezvous before a small dark brisk man in the dress of a coachman accosted us,-0.1729166666666667,0.3354166666666667
“ Are you the parties who come with Miss Morstan ” he asked,0.0,0.0
“ I am Miss Morstan and these two gentlemen are my friends ” said she,0.0,0.0
He bent a pair of wonderfully penetrating and questioning eyes upon us,1.0,1.0
“ You will excuse me miss ” he said with a certain dogged manner “ but I was to ask you to give me your word that neither of your companions is a police-officer ” “ I give you my word on that ” she answered,0.08214285714285713,0.3107142857142857
He gave a shrill whistle on which a street Arab led across a four-wheeler and opened the door,-0.4,0.6
The man who had addressed us mounted to the box while we took our places inside,0.0,0.0
We had hardly done so before the driver whipped up his horse and we plunged away at a furious pace through the foggy streets,-0.2916666666666667,0.5416666666666666
The situation was a curious one,-0.1,1.0
We were driving to an unknown place on an unknown errand,-0.1,0.6
Yet our invitation was either a complete hoax —which was an inconceivable hypothesis —or else we had good reason to think that important issues might hang upon our journey,0.39999999999999997,0.6666666666666666
Miss Morstan ’ s demeanor was as resolute and collected as ever,0.0,0.0
I endeavored to cheer and amuse her by reminiscences of my adventures in Afghanistan but to tell the truth I was myself so excited at our situation and so curious as to our destination that my stories were slightly involved,0.03611111111111112,0.638888888888889
To this day she declares that I told her one moving anecdote as to how a musket looked into my tent at the dead of night and how I fired a double-barrelled tiger cub at it,-0.2,0.4
At first I had some idea as to the direction in which we were driving but soon what with our pace the fog and my own limited knowledge of London I lost my bearings and knew nothing save that we seemed to be going a very long way,0.17839285714285713,0.499047619047619
Sherlock Holmes was never at fault however and he muttered the names as the cab rattled through squares and in and out by tortuous by-streets,0.0,0.0

Long lines of dull brick houses were only relieved by the coarse glare and tawdry brilliancy of public houses at the corner,-0.06833333333333333,0.49333333333333335
Then came rows of two-storied villas each with a fronting of miniature garden and then again interminable lines of new staring brick buildings —the monster tentacles which the giant city was throwing out into the country,0.06818181818181818,0.7272727272727273
At last the cab drew up at the third house in a new terrace,0.04545454545454545,0.17373737373737375
None of the other houses were inhabited and that at which we stopped was as dark as its neighbours save for a single glimmer in the kitchen window,-0.11547619047619047,0.32976190476190476
On our knocking however the door was instantly thrown open by a Hindoo servant clad in a yellow turban white loose-fitting clothes and a yellow sash,0.0,0.2333333333333333

A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it and a bald shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees,0.026333333333333337,0.367
He writhed his hands together as he stood and his features were in a perpetual jerk now smiling now scowling but never for an instant in repose,0.0,0.6666666666666666
Nature had given him a pendulous lip and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face,-0.16666666666666666,0.4444444444444444

Well then I trust that you have no objection to tobacco-smoke to the mild balsamic odour of the Eastern tobacco,0.3333333333333333,0.5
I am a little nervous and I find my hookah an invaluable sedative ” He applied a taper to the great bowl and the smoke bubbled merrily through the rose-water,0.30625,0.625
We sat all three in a semi-circle with our heads advanced and our chins upon our hands while the strange jerky little fellow with his high shining head puffed uneasily in the centre,0.080625,0.4475
“ When I first determined to make this communication to you ” said he “ I might have given you my address but I feared that you might disregard my request and bring unpleasant people with you,-0.19999999999999996,0.6416666666666666
I took the liberty therefore of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first,0.25,0.4861111111111111
I have complete confidence in his discretion and he had orders if he were dissatisfied to proceed no further in the matter,0.05,0.45
You will excuse these precautions but I am a man of somewhat retiring and I might even say refined tastes and there is nothing more unæsthetic than a policeman,0.225,0.275
I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism,0.0,0.4
I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd,-0.1,0.4
I live as you see with some little atmosphere of elegance around me,-0.025568181818181823,0.5
I may call myself a patron of the arts,0.0,0.0
It is my weakness,0.0,0.0
The landscape is a genuine Corot and though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa there can not be the least question about the Bouguereau,0.05000000000000002,0.45
I am partial to the modern French school ” “ You will excuse me Mr Sholto ” said Miss Morstan “ but I am here at your request to learn something which you desire to tell me,0.0125,0.1625
It is very late and I should desire the interview to be as short as possible ” “ At the best it must take some time ” he answered “ for we shall certainly have to go to Norwood and see Brother Bartholomew,0.16485714285714287,0.5902857142857142
We shall all go and try if we can get the better of Brother Bartholomew,0.5,0.5
He is very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to me,-0.18214285714285716,0.7678571428571428
I had quite high words with him last night,0.08,0.3033333333333333
You can not imagine what a terrible fellow he is when he is angry ” “ If we are to go to Norwood it would perhaps be as well to start at once ” I ventured to remark,-0.75,1.0
He laughed until his ears were quite red,0.35,0.1
“ That would hardly do ” he cried,-0.2916666666666667,0.5416666666666666
“ I don ’ t know what he would say if I brought you in that sudden way,0.0,0.5
No I must prepare you by showing you how we all stand to each other,-0.125,0.375
In the first place I must tell you that there are several points in the story of which I am myself ignorant,0.125,0.16666666666666666
I can only lay the facts before you as far as I know them myself,0.05,1.0
“ My father was as you may have guessed Major John Sholto once of the Indian army,0.0625,0.5
He retired some eleven years ago and came to live at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood,0.06818181818181818,0.25
He had prospered in India and brought back with him a considerable sum of money a large collection of valuable curiosities and a staff of native servants,0.10476190476190476,0.29285714285714287
With these advantages he bought himself a house and lived in great luxury,0.8,0.75
My twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children,0.0,1.0
“ I very well remember the sensation which was caused by the disappearance of Captain Morstan,0.2,0.3
We read the details in the papers and knowing that he had been a friend of our father ’ s we discussed the case freely in his presence,0.4,0.8
He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened,0.0,0.0
Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast —that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan,0.046666666666666655,0.62
“ We did know however that some mystery—some positive danger—overhung our father,0.22727272727272727,0.5454545454545454
He was very fearful of going out alone and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge,-1.0,1.0
Williams who drove you to-night was one of them,0.0,0.0
He was once light-weight champion of England,0.0,0.0
Our father would never tell us what it was he feared but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs,0.19999999999999998,0.3666666666666667
On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged man who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders,0.0,0.1
We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up,0.21428571428571427,0.42857142857142855
My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father ’ s but events have since led us to change our opinion,-0.5,0.5
“ Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him,0.45,0.525
He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened it and from that day he sickened to his death,0.1,0.4
What was in the letter we could never discover but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand,0.0,0.3
He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen but he now became rapidly worse and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope and that he wished to make a last communication to us,-0.2,0.3333333333333333
“ When we entered his room he was propped up with pillows and breathing heavily,-0.2,0.5
He besought us to lock the door and to come upon either side of the bed,0.0,0.0
Then grasping our hands he made a remarkable statement to us in a voice which was broken as much by emotion as by pain,0.18333333333333335,0.44999999999999996
I shall try and give it to you in his own very words,0.4,0.65
“ ‘ I have only one thing ’ he said ‘ which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment,0.0,1.0
It is my treatment of poor Morstan ’ s orphan,-0.4,0.6
The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure half at least of which should have been hers,-0.23333333333333334,0.2833333333333333
And yet I have made no use of it myself —so blind and foolish a thing is avarice,-0.5,0.6666666666666666
The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another,-0.5,0.5
See that chaplet dipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle,0.0,0.0
Even that I could not bear to part with although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her,0.0,0.0
You my sons will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure,0.7,0.9
But send her nothing—not even the chaplet—until I am gone,0.0,0.0
After all men have been as bad as this and have recovered,-0.6999999999999998,0.6666666666666666
“ ‘ I will tell you how Morstan died ’ he continued,0.0,0.0
‘ He had suffered for years from a weak heart but he concealed it from every one,-0.375,0.625
I alone knew it,0.0,0.0
When in India he and I through a remarkable chain of circumstances came into possession of a considerable treasure,0.425,0.6
I brought it over to England and on the night of Morstan ’ s arrival he came straight over here to claim his share,0.2,0.4
He walked over from the station and was admitted by my faithful old Lal Chowdar who is now dead,-0.05,0.30000000000000004
Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure and we came to heated words,0.0,0.0
Morstan had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side his face turned a dusky hue and he fell backwards cutting his head against the corner of the treasure-chest,-0.4333333333333333,0.5333333333333333
When I stooped over him I found to my horror that he was dead,-0.2,0.4
“ ‘ For a long time I sat half distracted wondering what I should do,-0.10833333333333334,0.2833333333333333
My first impulse was of course to call for assistance but I could not but recognise that there was every chance that I would be accused of his murder,0.25,0.3333333333333333
His death at the moment of a quarrel and the gash in his head would be black against me,-0.16666666666666666,0.43333333333333335
Again an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure which I was particularly anxious to keep secret,-0.325,0.85
He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone,0.0,0.0
There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know,0.0,0.0
“ ‘ I was still pondering over the matter when looking up I saw my servant Lal Chowdar in the doorway,0.0,0.0
He stole in and bolted the door behind him,-0.4,0.7
“ Do not fear Sahib ” he said,0.0,0.0
“ No one need know that you have killed him,-0.2,0.0
Let us hide him away and who is the wiser ” “ I did not kill him ” said I Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled,0.6,0.2
“ I heard it all Sahib ” said he,0.0,0.0
“ I heard you quarrel and I heard the blow,0.0,0.0
But my lips are sealed,0.0,0.0
All are asleep in the house,0.0,0.0
Let us put him away together ” That was enough to decide me,0.0,0.5
If my own servant could not believe my innocence how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box,0.6499999999999999,0.8
Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night and within a few days the London papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan,0.04999999999999999,0.5499999999999999
You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter,-0.2916666666666667,0.5416666666666666
My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body but also the treasure and that I have clung to Morstan ’ s share as well as to my own,0.3,1.0
I wish you therefore to make restitution,0.0,0.0
Put your ears down to my mouth,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
The treasure is hidden in— ’ “ At this instant a horrible change came over his expression his eyes stared wildly his jaw dropped and he yelled in a voice which I can never forget ‘ Keep him out,-0.2604166666666667,0.6
For Christ ’ s sake keep him out ’ We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed,-0.1666666666666667,0.43333333333333335
A face was looking in at us out of the darkness,0.0,0.0
We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass,0.0,0.0
It was a bearded hairy face with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence,-0.45,0.7
My brother and I rushed towards the window but the man was gone,0.0,0.0
When we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat,0.0,0.0
“ We searched the garden that night but found no sign of the intruder save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed,-0.07142857142857142,0.21428571428571427
But for that one trace we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild fierce face,0.1,0.4
We soon however had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us,0.09999999999999999,0.65
The window of my father ’ s room was found open in the morning his cupboards and boxes had been rifled and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper with the words ‘ The sign of the four ’ scrawled across it,0.05,0.35
What the phrase meant or who our secret visitor may have been we never knew,-0.4,0.7
As far as we can judge none of my father ’ s property had been actually stolen though everything had been turned out,0.05,0.55
My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life but it is still a complete mystery to us ” The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments,0.0425,0.38
We had all sat absorbed listening to his extraordinary narrative,0.31666666666666665,0.95
At the short account of her father ’ s death Miss Morstan had turned deadly white and for a moment I feared that she was about to faint,-0.16666666666666666,0.43333333333333335
She rallied however on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side-table,0.0,0.3333333333333333
Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes,0.0,0.15
As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life,-0.06666666666666667,0.3333333333333333
Here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost,-0.3,0.4
Mr Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced and then continued between the puffs of his overgrown pipe,-0.0625,0.4375
“ My brother and I ” said he “ were as you may imagine much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of,0.375,0.75
For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden without discovering its whereabouts,0.0,0.0
It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died,0.2,0.3
We could judge the splendour of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out,-0.2,0.05
Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion,-0.1875,0.5
The pearls were evidently of great value and he was averse to part with them for between friends my brother was himself a little inclined to my father ’ s fault,0.30625,0.625
He thought too that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble,-0.1,0.6
It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan ’ s address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals so that at least she might never feel destitute ” “ It was a kindly thought ” said our companion earnestly,0.13333333333333333,0.5
“ It was extremely good of you ” The little man waved his hand deprecatingly,0.25625,0.55
“ We were your trustees ” he said,0.0,0.0
“ That was the view which I took of it though Brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light,0.4,0.7
We had plenty of money ourselves,0.0,0.0
I desired no more,-0.25,0.5
Besides it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion,-0.19999999999999996,0.5222222222222221
‘ Le mauvais goût mène au crime ’ The French have a very neat way of putting these things,0.1,0.15
Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself so I left Pondicherry Lodge taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me,0.2066666666666667,0.36666666666666664
Yesterday however I learn that an event of extreme importance has occurred,-0.125,1.0
The treasure has been discovered,0.0,0.0
I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share,0.0,0.8333333333333333
I explained my views last night to Brother Bartholomew so we shall be expected if not welcome visitors ” Mr Thaddeus Sholto ceased and sat twitching on his luxurious settee,-0.16666666666666666,0.45555555555555555
We all remained silent with our thoughts upon the new development which the mysterious business had taken,0.04545454545454545,0.5181818181818182
Holmes was the first to spring to his feet,0.25,0.3333333333333333
“ You have done well sir from first to last ” said he,0.125,0.19999999999999998
“ It is possible that we may be able to make you some small return by throwing some light upon that which is still dark to you,0.1,0.6249999999999999
But as Miss Morstan remarked just now it is late and we had best put the matter through without delay ” Our new acquaintance very deliberately coiled up the tube of his hookah and produced from behind a curtain a very long befrogged topcoat with Astrakhan collar and cuffs,0.09522727272727272,0.47909090909090907
This he buttoned tightly up in spite of the extreme closeness of the night and finished his attire by putting on a rabbit-skin cap with hanging lappets which covered the ears so that no part of him was visible save his mobile and peaky face,-0.06785714285714287,0.5619047619047618
“ My health is somewhat fragile ” he remarked as he led the way down the passage,-0.07777777777777779,0.3944444444444445
“ I am compelled to be a valetudinarian ” Our cab was awaiting us outside and our programme was evidently prearranged for the driver started off at once at a rapid pace,0.125,0.15
Thaddeus Sholto talked incessantly in a voice which rose high above the rattle of the wheels,0.25333333333333335,0.5299999999999999
“ Bartholomew is a clever fellow ” said he,0.16666666666666666,0.8333333333333334
“ How do you think he found out where the treasure was,0.0,0.0
He had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors so he worked out all the cubic space of the house and made measurements everywhere so that not one inch should be unaccounted for,0.0,0.0
Among other things he found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms and making every allowance for the space between which he ascertained by borings he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet,0.125,0.5416666666666666
There were four feet unaccounted for,0.0,0.0
These could only be at the top of the building,0.25,0.75
He knocked a hole therefore in the lath-and-plaster ceiling of the highest room and there sure enough he came upon another little garret above it which had been sealed up and was known to no one,0.078125,0.49722222222222223
In the centre stood the treasure-chest resting upon two rafters,0.0,0.0
He lowered it through the hole and there it lies,0.0,0.0
He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling ” At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed,-0.041666666666666664,0.11666666666666667
Miss Morstan could we secure her rights would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England,0.4,0.6
Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me,0.15833333333333333,0.6805555555555556
I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation and then sat downcast with my head drooped deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance,-0.03181818181818183,0.2772727272727273
He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket,0.19999999999999998,0.5333333333333333
I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night,0.0,0.0
Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor oil while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative,0.5047619047619047,0.5595238095238095
However that may be I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door,0.019576719576719564,0.4534391534391535
“ This Miss Morstan is Pondicherry Lodge ” said Mr Thaddeus Sholto as he handed her out,0.0,0.0
Chapter V The Tragedy of Pondicherry Lodge It was nearly eleven o ’ clock when we reached this final stage of our night ’ s adventures,0.05,0.7
We had left the damp fog of the great city behind us and the night was fairly fine,0.20416666666666666,0.4875
A warm wind blew from the westward and heavy clouds moved slowly across the sky with half a moon peeping occasionally through the rifts,-0.013333333333333346,0.35833333333333334
It was clear enough to see for some distance but Thaddeus Sholto took down one of the side-lamps from the carriage to give us a better light upon our way,0.1688888888888889,0.47444444444444445
Pondicherry Lodge stood in its own grounds and was girt round with a very high stone wall topped with broken glass,0.05199999999999999,0.6255
A single narrow iron-clamped door formed the only means of entrance,-0.09047619047619049,0.5380952380952381
On this our guide knocked with a peculiar postman-like rat-tat,0.0,0.0
“ Who is there ” cried a gruff voice from within,0.0,0.0
“ It is I McMurdo,0.0,0.0
You surely know my knock by this time ” There was a grumbling sound and a clanking and jarring of keys,0.45,0.6444444444444444
The door swung heavily back and a short deep-chested man stood in the opening with the yellow light of the lantern shining upon his protruded face and twinkling distrustful eyes,0.1,0.25
“ That you Mr Thaddeus,0.0,0.0
But who are the others,0.0,0.0
I had no orders about them from the master ” “ No McMurdo,0.0,0.0
You surprise me,0.0,0.0
I told my brother last night that I should bring some friends ” “ He ain ’ t been out o ’ his room to-day Mr Thaddeus and I have no orders,0.0,0.06666666666666667
You know very well that I must stick to regulations,0.2,0.3
I can let you in but your friends must just stop where they are ” This was an unexpected obstacle,0.1,1.0
Thaddeus Sholto looked about him in a perplexed and helpless manner,0.4,0.9
“ This is too bad of you McMurdo ” he said,-0.8749999999999998,0.6666666666666666
“ If I guarantee them that is enough for you,0.0,0.5
There is the young lady too,0.1,0.4
She can not wait on the public road at this hour ” “ Very sorry Mr Thaddeus ” said the porter inexorably,-0.325,0.5333333333333333
“ Folk may be friends o ’ yours and yet no friends o ’ the master ’ s,0.0,0.0
He pays me well to do my duty and my duty I ’ ll do,0.0,0.0
I don ’ t know none o ’ your friends ” “ Oh yes you do McMurdo ” cried Sherlock Holmes genially,0.0,0.0
“ I don ’ t think you can have forgotten me,0.0,0.0
Don ’ t you remember the amateur who fought three rounds with you at Alison ’ s rooms on the night of your benefit four years back ” “ Not Mr Sherlock Holmes ” roared the prize-fighter,-0.125,0.125
“ God ’ s truth,0.0,0.0
how could I have mistook you,0.0,0.0
If instead o ’ standin ’ there so quiet you had just stepped up and given me that cross-hit of yours under the jaw I ’ d ha ’ known you without a question,0.0,0.3333333333333333
Ah you ’ re one that has wasted your gifts you have,-0.25,0.0
You might have aimed high if you had joined the fancy ” “ You see Watson if all else fails me I have still one of the scientific professions open to me ” said Holmes laughing,-0.11333333333333333,0.4466666666666666
“ Our friend won ’ t keep us out in the cold now I am sure ” “ In you come sir in you come —you and your friends ” he answered,-0.04999999999999999,0.9444444444444444
“ Very sorry Mr Thaddeus but orders are very strict,-0.225,0.65
Had to be certain of your friends before I let them in ” Inside a gravel path wound through desolate grounds to a huge clump of a house square and prosaic all plunged in shadow save where a moonbeam struck one corner and glimmered in a garret window,0.30714285714285716,0.7357142857142858
The vast size of the building with its gloom and its deathly silence struck a chill to the heart,-0.06666666666666667,0.5666666666666667
Even Thaddeus Sholto seemed ill at ease and the lantern quivered and rattled in his hand,-0.5,1.0
“ I can not understand it ” he said,0.0,0.0
“ There must be some mistake,0.0,0.0
I distinctly told Bartholomew that we should be here and yet there is no light in his window,0.04999999999999999,0.5
I do not know what to make of it ” “ Does he always guard the premises in this way ” asked Holmes,0.0,0.0
“ Yes he has followed my father ’ s custom,0.0,0.0
He was the favourite son you know and I sometimes think that my father may have told him more than he ever told me,0.5,0.5
That is Bartholomew ’ s window up there where the moonshine strikes,0.0,0.0
It is quite bright but there is no light from within I think ” “ None ” said Holmes,0.25,0.75
“ But I see the glint of a light in that little window beside the door ” “ Ah that is the housekeeper ’ s room,0.10625000000000001,0.6
That is where old Mrs Bernstone sits,0.1,0.2
She can tell us all about it,0.0,0.0
But perhaps you would not mind waiting here for a minute or two for if we all go in together and she has no word of our coming she may be alarmed,0.0,0.0
But hush,0.0,0.0
what is that ” He held up the lantern and his hand shook until the circles of light flickered and wavered all round us,0.1,0.55
Miss Morstan seized my wrist and we all stood with thumping hearts straining our ears,0.0,0.0
From the great black house there sounded through the silent night the saddest and most pitiful of sounds —the shrill broken whimpering of a frightened woman,0.055555555555555546,0.46388888888888885
“ It is Mrs Bernstone ” said Sholto,0.0,0.0
“ She is the only woman in the house,0.0,1.0
Wait here,0.0,0.0
I shall be back in a moment ” He hurried for the door and knocked in his peculiar way,0.0,0.0
We could see a tall old woman admit him and sway with pleasure at the very sight of him,0.15000000000000002,0.25
“ Oh Mr Thaddeus sir I am so glad you have come,0.625,1.0
I am so glad you have come Mr Thaddeus sir ” We heard her reiterated rejoicings until the door was closed and her voice died away into a muffled monotone,0.2625,0.55
Our guide had left us the lantern,0.0,0.0
Holmes swung it slowly round and peered keenly at the house and at the great rubbish-heaps which cumbered the grounds,0.30000000000000004,0.575
Miss Morstan and I stood together and her hand was in mine,0.0,0.0
A wondrous subtle thing is love for here were we two who had never seen each other before that day between whom no word or even look of affection had ever passed and yet now in an hour of trouble our hands instinctively sought for each other,-0.056666666666666664,0.41
I have marvelled at it since but at the time it seemed the most natural thing that I should go out to her so and as she has often told me there was in her also the instinct to turn to me for comfort and protection,0.3,0.45
So we stood hand in hand like two children and there was peace in our hearts for all the dark things that surrounded us,-0.15,0.4
“ What a strange place ” she said looking round,-0.13125,0.275
“ It looks as though all the moles in England had been let loose in it,-0.07692307692307693,0.2692307692307692
I have seen something of the sort on the side of a hill near Ballarat where the prospectors had been at work ” “ And from the same cause ” said Holmes,0.05,0.2625
“ These are the traces of the treasure-seekers,0.0,0.0
You must remember that they were six years looking for it,0.0,0.0
No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit ” At that moment the door of the house burst open and Thaddeus Sholto came running out with his hands thrown forward and terror in his eyes,0.0,0.5
“ There is something amiss with Bartholomew ” he cried,0.0,0.0
“ I am frightened,0.0,0.0
My nerves can not stand it ” He was indeed half blubbering with fear and his twitching feeble face peeping out from the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a terrified child,0.15833333333333335,0.6041666666666667
“ Come into the house ” said Holmes in his crisp firm way,0.024999999999999994,0.4083333333333333
“ Yes do ” pleaded Thaddeus Sholto,0.0,0.0
“ I really do not feel equal to giving directions ” We all followed him into the housekeeper ’ s room which stood upon the left-hand side of the passage,-0.05,0.225
The old woman was pacing up and down with a scared look and restless picking fingers but the sight of Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her,-0.02777777777777779,0.24444444444444446
“ God bless your sweet calm face ” she cried with an hysterical sob,-0.09166666666666663,0.7999999999999999
“ It does me good to see you,0.7,0.6000000000000001
Oh but I have been sorely tried this day ” Our companion patted her thin work-worn hand and murmured some few words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the colour back into the other ’ s bloodless cheeks,-0.14500000000000002,0.385
“ Master has locked himself in and will not answer me ” she explained,0.0,0.0
“ All day I have waited to hear from him for he often likes to be alone but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss so I went up and peeped through the key-hole,0.0,0.0
You must go up Mr Thaddeus —you must go up and look for yourself,0.0,0.0
I have seen Mr Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years but I never saw him with such a face on him as that ” Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way for Thaddeus Sholto ’ s teeth were chattering in his head,0.1875,0.275
So shaken was he that I had to pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs for his knees were trembling under him,0.0,0.0
Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting which served as a stair-carpet,-0.26666666666666666,0.6
He walked slowly from step to step holding the lamp and shooting keen glances to right and left,-0.004761904761904782,0.3119047619047619
Miss Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper,-0.4,0.7
The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some length with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it and three doors upon the left,0.2571428571428571,0.3371428571428571
Holmes advanced along it in the same slow and methodical way while we kept close at his heels with our long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor,-0.04537037037037037,0.37453703703703706
The third door was that which we were seeking,0.0,0.0
Holmes knocked without receiving any answer and then tried to turn the handle and force it open,0.0,0.5
It was locked on the inside however and by a broad and powerful bolt as we could see when we set our lamp up against it,0.18125,0.65625
The key being turned however the hole was not entirely closed,0.025,0.55
Sherlock Holmes bent down to it and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of the breath,0.10648148148148147,0.662962962962963
“ There is something devilish in this Watson ” said he more moved than I had ever before seen him,0.5,0.5
“ What do you make of it ” I stooped to the hole and recoiled in horror,0.0,0.0
Moonlight was streaming into the room and it was bright with a vague and shifty radiance,0.10000000000000003,0.6499999999999999
Looking straight at me and suspended as it were in the air for all beneath was in shadow there hung a face —the very face of our companion Thaddeus,0.2,0.35
There was the same high shining head the same circular bristle of red hair the same bloodless countenance,0.032,0.183
The features were set however in a horrible smile a fixed and unnatural grin which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring to the nerves than any scowl or contortion,-0.024999999999999994,0.45
So like was the face to that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure that he was indeed with us,0.0375,0.5962962962962962
Then I recalled to mind that he had mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins,0.0,0.0
“ This is terrible ” I said to Holmes,-1.0,1.0
“ What is to be done ” “ The door must come down ” he answered and springing against it he put all his weight upon the lock,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
It creaked and groaned but did not yield,0.0,0.0
Together we flung ourselves upon it once more and this time it gave way with a sudden snap and we found ourselves within Bartholomew Sholto ’ s chamber,0.25,0.5
It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory,0.0,0.0
A double line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite the door and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners test-tubes and retorts,0.0,0.0
In the corners stood carboys of acid in wicker baskets,0.0,0.0
One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken for a stream of dark-coloured liquid had trickled out from it and the air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent tar-like odour,-0.30000000000000004,0.45
A set of steps stood at one side of the room in the midst of a litter of lath and plaster and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large enough for a man to pass through,0.07142857142857142,0.3428571428571428
At the foot of the steps a long coil of rope was thrown carelessly together,-0.275,0.65
By the table in a wooden arm-chair the master of the house was seated all in a heap with his head sunk upon his left shoulder and that ghastly inscrutable smile upon his face,0.09999999999999999,0.03333333333333333
He was stiff and cold and had clearly been dead many hours,-0.08285714285714288,0.5566666666666666
It seemed to me that not only his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most fantastic fashion,0.1,0.85
By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar instrument —a brown close-grained stick with a stone head like a hammer rudely lashed on with coarse twine,-0.15,0.55
Beside it was a torn sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it,0.0,0.0
Holmes glanced at it and then handed it to me,0.0,0.0
“ You see ” he said with a significant raising of the eyebrows,0.375,0.875
In the light of the lantern I read with a thrill of horror “ The sign of the four ” “ In God ’ s name what does it all mean ” I asked,0.04375000000000001,0.69375
“ It means murder ” said he stooping over the dead man,-0.2,0.4
“ Ah I expected it,-0.1,0.4
Look here ” He pointed to what looked like a long dark thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear,-0.06666666666666667,0.3
“ It looks like a thorn ” said I,0.0,0.0
“ It is a thorn,0.0,0.0
You may pick it out,0.0,0.0
But be careful for it is poisoned ” I took it up between my finger and thumb,-0.1,1.0
It came away from the skin so readily that hardly any mark was left behind,-0.12291666666666667,0.4354166666666666
One tiny speck of blood showed where the puncture had been,0.0,0.5
“ This is all an insoluble mystery to me ” said I,0.0,0.0
“ It grows darker instead of clearer ” “ On the contrary ” he answered “ it clears every instant,0.0,0.6666666666666666
I only require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case ” We had almost forgotten our companion ’ s presence since we entered the chamber,-0.1,0.44375000000000003
He was still standing in the doorway the very picture of terror wringing his hands and moaning to himself,0.2,0.3
Suddenly however he broke out into a sharp querulous cry,-0.0625,0.625
“ The treasure is gone ” he said,0.0,0.0
“ They have robbed him of the treasure,0.0,0.0
There is the hole through which we lowered it,0.0,0.0
I helped him to do it,0.0,0.0
I was the last person who saw him,0.0,0.06666666666666667
I left him here last night and I heard him lock the door as I came downstairs ” “ What time was that ” “ It was ten o ’ clock,0.0,0.022222222222222223
And now he is dead and the police will be called in and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it,-0.2,0.4
Oh yes I am sure I shall,0.5,0.8888888888888888
But you don ’ t think so gentlemen,0.0,0.0
Surely you don ’ t think that it was I,0.5,0.8888888888888888
Is it likely that I would have brought you here if it were I,0.0,1.0
Oh dear,0.0,0.0
oh dear,0.0,0.0
I know that I shall go mad ” He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive frenzy,-0.09062500000000001,0.95
“ You have no reason for fear Mr Sholto ” said Holmes kindly putting his hand upon his shoulder,0.6,0.9
“ Take my advice and drive down to the station to report this matter to the police,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
Offer to assist them in every way,0.0,0.0
We shall wait here until your return ” The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion and we heard him stumbling down the stairs in the dark,-0.16435185185185186,0.39629629629629637
Chapter VI Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration “ Now Watson ” said Holmes rubbing his hands “ we have half an hour to ourselves,-0.16666666666666666,0.16666666666666666
Let us make good use of it,0.7,0.6000000000000001
My case is as I have told you almost complete but we must not err on the side of over-confidence,0.1,0.4
Simple as the case seems now there may be something deeper underlying it ” “ Simple ” I ejaculated,0.0,0.35714285714285715
“ Surely ” said he with something of the air of a clinical professor expounding to his class,0.5,0.8888888888888888
“ Just sit in the corner there that your footprints may not complicate matters,0.0,0.0
Now to work,0.0,0.0
In the first place how did these folk come and how did they go,0.25,0.3333333333333333
The door has not been opened since last night,0.0,0.06666666666666667
How of the window ” He carried the lamp across to it muttering his observations aloud the while but addressing them to himself rather than to me,0.0,0.0
“ Window is snibbed on the inner side,0.0,0.16666666666666666
Framework is solid,0.0,0.1
No hinges at the side,0.0,0.0
Let us open it,0.0,0.5
No water-pipe near,0.1,0.4
Roof quite out of reach,0.0,0.0
Yet a man has mounted by the window,0.0,0.0
It rained a little last night,-0.09375,0.2833333333333333
Here is the print of a foot in mould upon the sill,0.0,0.0
And here is a circular muddy mark and here again upon the floor and here again by the table,0.0,0.0
See here Watson,0.0,0.0
This is really a very pretty demonstration ” I looked at the round well-defined muddy discs,0.0625,0.7
“ This is not a footmark ” said I,0.0,0.0
“ It is something much more valuable to us,0.5,0.5
It is the impression of a wooden stump,0.0,0.0
You see here on the sill is the boot-mark a heavy boot with the broad metal heel and beside it is the mark of the timber-toe ” “ It is the wooden-legged man ” “ Quite so,-0.06875,0.40625
But there has been some one else —a very able and efficient ally,0.65,0.8125
Could you scale that wall doctor ” I looked out of the open window,0.0,0.5
The moon still shone brightly on that angle of the house,0.7000000000000001,0.7999999999999999
We were a good sixty feet from the ground and look where I would I could see no foothold nor as much as a crevice in the brick-work,0.44999999999999996,0.4
“ It is absolutely impossible ” I answered,-0.6666666666666666,1.0
“ Without aid it is so,0.0,0.0
But suppose you had a friend up here who lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner securing one end of it to this great hook in the wall,0.75,0.675
Then I think if you were an active man You might swarm up wooden leg and all,-0.06666666666666667,0.3
You would depart of course in the same fashion and your ally would draw up the rope untie it from the hook shut the window snib it on the inside and get away in the way that he originally came,0.1875,0.4375
As a minor point it may be noted ” he continued fingering the rope “ that our wooden-legged friend though a fair climber was not a professional sailor,0.19999999999999996,0.4000000000000001
His hands were far from horny,0.1,1.0
My lens discloses more than one blood-mark especially towards the end of the rope from which I gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin off his hand ” “ This is all very well ” said I “ but the thing becomes more unintelligible than ever,0.17407407407407408,0.5148148148148147
How about this mysterious ally,0.0,1.0
How came he into the room ” “ Yes the ally ” repeated Holmes pensively,0.0,0.0
“ There are features of interest about this ally,0.0,0.0
He lifts the case from the regions of the commonplace,0.0,0.0
I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals of crime in this country —though parallel cases suggest themselves from India and if my memory serves me from Senegambia ” “ How came he then ” I reiterated,0.15,0.25
“ The door is locked the window is inaccessible,0.0,0.0
Was it through the chimney ” “ The grate is much too small ” he answered,-0.024999999999999994,0.30000000000000004
“ I had already considered that possibility ” “ How then ” I persisted,0.0,0.0
“ You will not apply my precept ” he said shaking his head,0.0,0.0
“ How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth,-0.6666666666666666,1.0
We know that he did not come through the door the window or the chimney,0.0,0.0
We also know that he could not have been concealed in the room as there is no concealment possible,0.0,1.0
Whence then did he come ” “ He came through the hole in the roof ” I cried,0.0,0.0
“ Of course he did,0.0,0.0
He must have done so,0.0,0.0
If you will have the kindness to hold the lamp for me we shall now extend our researches to the room above —the secret room in which the treasure was found ” He mounted the steps and seizing a rafter with either hand he swung himself up into the garret,-0.4,0.7
Then lying on his face he reached down for the lamp and held it while I followed him,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way and six the other,-0.0625,0.1875
The floor was formed by the rafters with thin lath-and-plaster between so that in walking one had to step from beam to beam,-0.4,0.8500000000000001
The roof ran up to an apex and was evidently the inner shell of the true roof of the house,0.19999999999999998,0.35555555555555557
There was no furniture of any sort and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor,-0.30000000000000004,0.475
“ Here you are you see ” said Sherlock Holmes putting his hand against the sloping wall,0.0,0.0
“ This is a trap-door which leads out on to the roof,0.0,0.0
I can press it back and here is the roof itself sloping at a gentle angle,0.1,0.4
This then is the way by which Number One entered,0.0,0.0
Let us see if we can find any other traces of his individuality ” He held down the lamp to the floor and as he did so I saw for the second time that night a startled surprised look come over his face,-0.04513888888888889,0.3909722222222223
For myself as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes,-0.6,1.0
The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked foot —clear well defined perfectly formed but scarce half the size of those of an ordinary man,0.056666666666666664,0.5083333333333333
“ Holmes ” I said in a whisper “ a child has done the horrid thing ” He had recovered his self-possession in an instant,0.0,0.6666666666666666
“ I was staggered for the moment ” he said “ but the thing is quite natural,0.1,0.4
My memory failed me or I should have been able to foretell it,0.0,0.4625
There is nothing more to be learned here,0.5,0.5
Let us go down ” “ What is your theory then as to those footmarks ” I asked eagerly when we had regained the lower room once more,0.17222222222222222,0.3944444444444445
“ My dear Watson try a little analysis yourself ” said he with a touch of impatience,-0.1875,0.5
“ You know my methods,0.0,0.0
Apply them and it will be instructive to compare results ” “ I can not conceive anything which will cover the facts ” I answered,0.0,0.0
“ It will be clear enough to you soon ” he said in an off-hand way,0.05000000000000001,0.44166666666666665
“ I think that there is nothing else of importance here but I will look ” He whipped out his lens and a tape measure and hurried about the room on his knees measuring comparing examining with his long thin nose only a few inches from the planks and his beady eyes gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird,-0.1625,0.5875
So swift silent and furtive were his movements like those of a trained blood-hound picking out a scent that I could not but think what a terrible criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity against the law instead of exerting them in its defence,-0.375,0.5375000000000001
As he hunted about he kept muttering to himself and finally he broke out into a loud crow of delight,0.05,0.9
“ We are certainly in luck ” said he,0.21428571428571427,0.5714285714285714
“ We ought to have very little trouble now,-0.22187500000000002,0.42500000000000004
Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the creosote,0.0,0.0
You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here at the side of this evil-smelling mess,-0.2125,0.2875
The carboy has been cracked You see and the stuff has leaked out ” “ What then ” I asked,0.0,0.0
“ Why we have got him that ’ s all ” said he,0.0,0.0
“ I know a dog that would follow that scent to the world ’ s end,0.0,0.0
If a pack can track a trailed herring across a shire how far can a specially-trained hound follow so pungent a smell as this,0.1,1.0
It sounds like a sum in the rule of three,0.0,0.0
The answer should give us the—But halloa,0.0,0.0
here are the accredited representatives of the law ” Heavy steps and the clamour of loud voices were audible from below and the hall door shut with a loud crash,0.0,0.7000000000000001
“ Before they come ” said Holmes “ just put your hand here on this poor fellow ’ s arm and here on his leg,-0.4,0.6
What do you feel ” “ The muscles are as hard as a board ” I answered,-0.2916666666666667,0.5416666666666666
“ Quite so,0.0,0.0
They are in a state of extreme contraction far exceeding the usual rigor mortis,-0.09166666666666667,0.75
Coupled with this distortion of the face this Hippocratic smile or ‘ risus sardonicus ’ as the old writers called it what conclusion would it suggest to your mind ” “ Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid ” I answered — “ some strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus ” “ That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn muscles of the face,0.175,0.4916666666666667
On getting into the room I at once looked for the means by which the poison had entered the system,0.0,0.0
As you saw I discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force into the scalp,-0.4,0.75
You observe that the part struck was that which would be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in his chair,0.0,0.0
Now examine the thorn ” I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern,0.4,0.7
It was long sharp and black with a glazed look near the point as though some gummy substance had dried upon it,-0.08833333333333333,0.5166666666666667
The blunt end had been trimmed and rounded off with a knife,0.0,0.0
“ Is that an English thorn ” he asked,0.0,0.0
“ No it certainly is not ” “ With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference,0.19642857142857142,0.5982142857142857
But here are the regulars so the auxiliary forces may beat a retreat ” As he spoke the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on the passage and a very stout portly man in a grey suit strode heavily into the room,0.012500000000000011,0.42500000000000004
He was red-faced burly and plethoric with a pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from between swollen and puffy pouches,-0.325,0.52
He was closely followed by an inspector in uniform and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto,0.0,0.0
“ Here ’ s a business ” he cried in a muffled husky voice,0.0,0.0
“ Here ’ s a pretty business,0.3125,1.0
But who are all these,0.0,0.0
Why the house seems to be as full as a rabbit-warren ” “ I think you must recollect me Mr Athelney Jones ” said Holmes quietly,0.21875,0.44166666666666665
“ Why of course I do ” he wheezed,0.0,0.0
“ It ’ s Mr Sherlock Holmes the theorist,0.0,0.0
Remember you,0.0,0.0
I ’ ll never forget how you lectured us all on causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case,0.0,0.0
It ’ s true you set us on the right track but you ’ ll own now that it was more by good luck than good guidance ” “ It was a piece of very simple reasoning ” “ Oh come now come,0.44795918367346943,0.6214285714285716

How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another case,0.41666666666666663,0.8333333333333334
I was at the station when the message arrived,0.0,0.0
What d ’ you think the man died of ” “ Oh this is hardly a case for me to theorise over ” said Holmes dryly,-0.2916666666666667,0.5416666666666666
“ No no,0.0,0.0
Still we can ’ t deny that you hit the nail on the head sometimes,0.0,0.0

These flashes come upon me at times.—Just step outside sergeant and you Mr Sholto,0.0,0.05
Your friend can remain.—What do you think of this Holmes,0.0,0.0
Sholto was on his own confession with his brother last night,0.3,0.5333333333333333
The brother died in a fit on which Sholto walked off with the treasure,0.4,0.4
How ’ s that ” “ On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside ” “ Hum,0.024999999999999994,0.35
There ’ s a flaw there,0.0,0.0
Let us apply common sense to the matter,-0.3,0.5
This Thaddeus Sholto was with his brother there was a quarrel so much we know,0.2,0.2
The brother is dead and the jewels are gone,-0.2,0.4
So much also we know,0.2,0.2
No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him,0.0,0.0
His bed had not been slept in,0.0,0.0
Thaddeus is evidently in a most disturbed state of mind,0.5,0.5
His appearance is—well not attractive,-0.4,1.0
You see that I am weaving my web round Thaddeus,-0.2,0.4
The net begins to close upon him ” “ You are not quite in possession of the facts yet ” said Holmes,0.0,0.0
“ This splinter of wood which I have every reason to believe to be poisoned was in the man ’ s scalp where you still see the mark this card inscribed as you see it was on the table and beside it lay this rather curious stone-headed instrument,-0.1,1.0
How does all that fit into your theory ” “ Confirms it in every respect ” said the fat detective pompously,0.4,0.4
“ House is full of Indian curiosities,0.35,0.55
Thaddeus brought this up and if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made murderous use of it as any other man,-0.125,0.375
The card is some hocus-pocus —a blind as like as not,-0.5,0.6666666666666666
The only question is how did he depart,0.0,1.0
Ah of course here is a hole in the roof ” With great activity considering his bulk he sprang up the steps and squeezed through into the garret and immediately afterwards we heard his exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door,0.8,0.75
“ He can find something ” remarked Holmes shrugging his shoulders,0.0,0.0
“ He has occasional glimmerings of reason,0.0,0.125

“ Facts are better than mere theories after all,0.0,0.5
My view of the case is confirmed,0.4,1.0
There is a trap-door communicating with the roof and it is partly open ” “ It was I who opened it ” “ Oh indeed,0.0,0.5

“ Don ’ t trouble yourself about it Mr Sholto ” said Holmes,-0.2,0.2
“ I think that I can engage to clear you of the charge ” “ Don ’ t promise too much Mr Theorist —don ’ t promise too much ” snapped the detective,0.18333333333333335,0.26111111111111107
“ You may find it a harder matter than you think ” “ Not only will I clear him Mr Jones but I will make you a free present of the name and description of one of the two people who were in this room last night,0.06666666666666667,0.37500000000000006
His name I have every reason to believe is Jonathan Small,-0.25,0.4
He is a poorly-educated man small active with his right leg off and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the inner side,-0.01952380952380952,0.3404761904761905
His left boot has a coarse square-toed sole with an iron band round the heel,-0.05,0.2875
He is a middle-aged man much sunburned and has been a convict,0.2,0.2
These few indications may be of some assistance to you coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of skin missing from the palm of his hand,0.09999999999999998,0.25000000000000006
The other man— ” “ Ah,-0.15625,0.375
the other man— ” asked Athelney Jones in a sneering voice but impressed none the less as I could easily see by the precision of the other ’ s manner,0.2033333333333333,0.53
“ Is a rather curious person ” said Sherlock Holmes turning upon his heel,-0.1,1.0
“ I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the pair of them.—A word with you Watson ” He led me out to the head of the stair,0.2175,0.5725
“ This unexpected occurrence ” he said “ has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose of our journey ” “ I have just been thinking so ” I answered,0.2375,0.875
“ It is not right that Miss Morstan should remain in this stricken house ” “ No,-0.14285714285714285,0.5357142857142857

I will wait for you here if you will drive out again,0.0,0.0
Or perhaps you are too tired ” “ By no means,-0.4,0.7
I don ’ t think I could rest until I know more of this fantastic business,0.45,0.7
I have seen something of the rough side of life but I give you my word that this quick succession of strange surprises to-night has shaken my nerve completely,0.07083333333333333,0.36250000000000004
I should like however to see the matter through with you now that I have got so far ” “ Your presence will be of great service to me ” he answered,0.45,0.875
“ We shall work the case out independently and leave this fellow Jones to exult over any mare ’ s-nest which he may choose to construct,0.0,0.125

The third house on the right-hand side is a bird-stuffer ’ s Sherman is the name,0.0,0.0
You will see a weasel holding a young rabbit in the window,0.1,0.4
Knock old Sherman up and tell him with my compliments that I want Toby at once,0.1,0.2
You will bring Toby back in the cab with you ” “ A dog I suppose ” “ Yes —a queer mongrel with a most amazing power of scent,0.3666666666666667,0.4666666666666666
I would rather have Toby ’ s help than that of the whole detective force of London ” “ I shall bring him then ” said I,0.2,0.4
“ It is one now,0.0,0.0
I ought to be back before three if I can get a fresh horse ” “ And I ” said Holmes “ shall see what I can learn from Mrs Bernstone and from the Indian servant who Mr Thaddeus tell me sleeps in the next garret,0.09999999999999999,0.16666666666666666
Then I shall study the great Jones ’ s methods and listen to his not too delicate sarcasms,0.25,0.825
‘ Wir sind gewohnt das die Menschen verhöhnen was sie nicht verstehen ’ Goethe is always pithy ” Chapter VII The Episode of the Barrel The police had brought a cab with them and in this I escorted Miss Morstan back to her home,0.0,0.0
After the angelic fashion of women she had borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker than herself to support and I had found her bright and placid by the side of the frightened housekeeper,0.09000000000000002,0.57
In the cab however she first turned faint and then burst into a passion of weeping —so sorely had she been tried by the adventures of the night,-0.125,0.6666666666666666
She has told me since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey,-0.35,0.675
She little guessed the struggle within my breast or the effort of self-restraint which held me back,-0.09375,0.25
My sympathies and my love went out to her even as my hand had in the garden,0.5,0.6
I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences,0.36666666666666664,0.6
Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips,0.0,0.0
She was weak and helpless shaken in mind and nerve,-0.375,0.625
It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time,0.25,0.55
Worse still she was rich,-0.012500000000000011,0.675
If Holmes ’ s researches were successful she would be an heiress,0.75,0.95
Was it fair was it honourable that a half-pay surgeon should take such advantage of an intimacy which chance had brought about,0.35,0.7
Might she not look upon me as a mere vulgar fortune-seeker,-0.6,0.65
I could not bear to risk that such a thought should cross her mind,0.0,0.25
This Agra treasure intervened like an impassable barrier between us,0.0,0.0
It was nearly two o ’ clock when we reached Mrs Cecil Forrester ’ s,0.1,0.4
The servants had retired hours ago but Mrs Forrester had been so interested by the strange message which Miss Morstan had received that she had sat up in the hope of her return,0.1,0.325
She opened the door herself a middle-aged graceful woman and it gave me joy to see how tenderly her arm stole round the other ’ s waist and how motherly was the voice in which she greeted her,0.15833333333333335,0.325
She was clearly no mere paid dependant but an honoured friend,0.25,0.5
I was introduced and Mrs Forrester earnestly begged me to step in and tell her our adventures,0.0,0.0
I explained however the importance of my errand and promised faithfully to call and report any progress which we might make with the case,0.0,0.0
As we drove away I stole a glance back and I still seem to see that little group on the step the two graceful clinging figures the half-opened door the hall-light shining through stained glass the barometer and the bright stair-rods,0.17083333333333336,0.4333333333333333
It was soothing to catch even that passing glimpse of a tranquil English home in the midst of the wild dark business which had absorbed us,0.0625,0.42500000000000004
And the more I thought of what had happened the wilder and darker it grew,0.5,0.5
I reviewed the whole extraordinary sequence of events as I rattled on through the silent gas-lit streets,0.17777777777777778,0.5
There was the original problem that at least was pretty clear now,0.10625000000000001,0.6333333333333333
The death of Captain Morstan the sending of the pearls the advertisement the letter —we had had light upon all those events,0.4,0.7
They had only led us however to a deeper and far more tragic mystery,-0.037500000000000006,0.8125
The Indian treasure the curious plan found among Morstan ’ s baggage the strange scene at Major Sholto ’ s death the rediscovery of the treasure immediately followed by the murder of the discoverer the very singular accompaniments to the crime the footsteps the remarkable weapons the words upon the card corresponding with those upon Captain Morstan ’ s chart —here was indeed a labyrinth in which a man less singularly endowed than my fellow-lodger might well despair of ever finding the clue,0.11597222222222224,0.4611111111111112

At last however there was the glint of a candle behind the blind and a face looked out at the upper window,-0.225,0.3583333333333333
“ Go on you drunken vagabone ” said the face,0.0,0.0
“ If you kick up any more row I ’ ll open the kennels and let out forty-three dogs upon you ” “ If you ’ ll let one out it ’ s just what I have come for ” said I,0.25,0.5

Mr Sherman was a lanky lean old man with stooping shoulders a stringy neck and blue-tinted glasses,0.1,0.2
“ A friend of Mr Sherlock is always welcome ” said he,0.8,0.9

What was it that Mr Sherlock Holmes wanted sir ” “ He wanted a dog of yours ” “ Ah,0.0,0.0
that would be Toby ” “ Yes Toby was the name ” “ Toby lives at No,0.0,0.0
7 on the left here ” He moved slowly forward with his candle among the queer animal family which he had gathered round him,-0.16666666666666666,0.26666666666666666
In the uncertain shadowy light I could see dimly that there were glancing glimmering eyes peeping down at us from every cranny and corner,0.11481481481481481,0.4962962962962963
Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn fowls who lazily shifted their weight from one leg to the other as our voices disturbed their slumbers,-0.125,0.4916666666666667
Toby proved to be an ugly long-haired lop-eared creature half spaniel and half lurcher brown-and-white in colour with a very clumsy waddling gait,-0.35583333333333333,0.4633333333333334
It accepted after some hesitation a lump of sugar which the old naturalist handed to me and having thus sealed an alliance it followed me to the cab and made no difficulties about accompanying me,0.1,0.2
It had just struck three on the Palace clock when I found myself back once more at Pondicherry Lodge,0.25,0.25
The ex-prize-fighter McMurdo had I found been arrested as an accessory and both he and Mr Sholto had been marched off to the station,0.0,0.0

And dip my handkerchief into the creasote,0.0,0.0
That will do,0.0,0.0
Now come up into the garret with me for a moment ” We clambered up through the hole,0.0,0.0
Holmes turned his light once more upon the footsteps in the dust,0.45,0.6
“ I wish you particularly to notice these footmarks ” he said,0.16666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
“ Do you observe anything noteworthy about them ” “ They belong ” I said “ to a child or a small woman ” “ Apart from their size though,-0.25,0.4
Is there nothing else ” “ They appear to be much as other footmarks ” “ Not at all,-0.125,0.375
Look here,0.0,0.0
This is the print of a right foot in the dust,0.2857142857142857,0.5357142857142857
Now I make one with my naked foot beside it,0.0,0.4
What is the chief difference ” “ Your toes are all cramped together,0.0,0.0
The other print has each toe distinctly divided ” “ Quite so,0.0875,0.3375
That is the point,0.0,0.0
Bear that in mind,0.0,0.0
Now would you kindly step over to that flap-window and smell the edge of the wood-work,0.6,0.9
I shall stay here as I have this handkerchief in my hand ” I did as he directed and was instantly conscious of a strong tarry smell,0.26666666666666666,0.6166666666666667
“ That is where he put his foot in getting out,0.0,0.0
If you can trace him I should think that Toby will have no difficulty,0.0,0.0
Now run downstairs loose the dog and look out for Blondin ” By the time that I got out into the grounds Sherlock Holmes was on the roof and I could see him like an enormous glow-worm crawling very slowly along the ridge,-0.15564102564102567,0.5630769230769231
I lost sight of him behind a stack of chimneys but he presently reappeared and then vanished once more upon the opposite side,0.024999999999999994,0.3
When I made my way round there I found him seated at one of the corner eaves,-0.2,0.4
“ That you Watson ” he cried,0.0,0.0
“ Yes ” “ This is the place,0.0,0.0
What is that black thing down there ” “ A water-barrel ” “ Top on it ” “ Yes ” “ No sign of a ladder ” “ No ” “ Confound the fellow,0.10092592592592592,0.40740740740740744

I ought to be able to come down where he could climb up,0.17222222222222222,0.4569444444444445
The water-pipe feels pretty firm,0.024999999999999994,0.7
Here goes anyhow ” There was a scuffling of feet and the lantern began to come steadily down the side of the wall,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
Then with a light spring he came on to the barrel and from there to the earth,0.4,0.7
“ It was easy to follow him ” he said drawing on his stockings and boots,0.43333333333333335,0.8333333333333334
“ Tiles were loosened the whole way along and in his hurry he had dropped this,0.2,0.4
It confirms my diagnosis as you doctors express it ” The object which he held up to me was a small pocket or pouch woven out of coloured grasses and with a few tawdry beads strung round it,-0.21666666666666667,0.3
In shape and size it was not unlike a cigarette-case,0.0,0.0
Inside were half a dozen spines of dark wood sharp at one end and rounded at the other like that which had struck Bartholomew Sholto,-0.14166666666666666,0.42291666666666666
“ They are hellish things ” said he,0.0,0.0

“ Your leg will stand it ” “ Oh yes ” “ Here you are doggy,0.0,0.0
Good old Toby,0.4125,0.4
Smell it Toby smell it ” He pushed the creasote handkerchief under the dog ’ s nose while the creature stood with its fluffy legs separated and with a most comical cock to its head like a connoisseur sniffing the bouquet of a famous vintage,0.325,0.725
Holmes then threw the handkerchief to a distance fastened a stout cord to the mongrel ’ s collar and led him to the foot of the water-barrel,0.0,0.0
The creature instantly broke into a succession of high tremulous yelps and with his nose on the ground and his tail in the air pattered off upon the trail at a pace which strained his leash and kept us at the top of our speed,0.22,0.5688888888888889
The east had been gradually whitening and we could now see some distance in the cold grey light,-0.08333333333333333,0.6
The square massive house with its black empty windows and high bare walls towered up sad and forlorn behind us,-0.13666666666666666,0.6104761904761905
Our course led right across the grounds in and out among the trenches and pits with which they were scarred and intersected,0.2857142857142857,0.5357142857142857
The whole place with its scattered dirt-heaps and ill-grown shrubs had a blighted ill-omened look which harmonized with the black tragedy which hung over it,0.016666666666666677,0.4166666666666667
On reaching the boundary wall Toby ran along whining eagerly underneath its shadow and stopped finally in a corner screened by a young beech,0.05,0.7
Where the two walls joined several bricks had been loosened and the crevices left were worn down and rounded upon the lower side as though they had frequently been used as a ladder,-0.013888888888888895,0.14722222222222223
Holmes clambered up and taking the dog from me he dropped it over upon the other side,-0.125,0.375
“ There ’ s the print of wooden-leg ’ s hand ” he remarked as I mounted up beside him,0.0,0.0
“ You see the slight smudge of blood upon the white plaster,-0.08333333333333333,0.08333333333333333
What a lucky thing it is that we have had no very heavy rain since yesterday,0.21474358974358973,0.608974358974359
The scent will lie upon the road in spite of their eight-and-twenty hours ’ start ” I confess that I had my doubts myself when I reflected upon the great traffic which had passed along the London road in the interval,0.8,0.75
My fears were soon appeased however,0.0,0.0
Toby never hesitated or swerved but waddled on in his peculiar rolling fashion,0.0,0.0
Clearly the pungent smell of the creasote rose high above all other contending scents,0.147,0.4696666666666666
“ Do not imagine ” said Holmes “ that I depend for my success in this case upon the mere chance of one of these fellows having put his foot in the chemical,-0.1,0.25
I have knowledge now which would enable me to trace them in many different ways,0.25,0.55
This however is the readiest and since fortune has put it into our hands I should be culpable if I neglected it,0.0,0.0
It has however prevented the case from becoming the pretty little intellectual problem which it at one time promised to be,0.203125,0.6875
There might have been some credit to be gained out of it but for this too palpable clue ” “ There is credit and to spare ” said I,0.0,0.5
“ I assure you Holmes that I marvel at the means by which you obtain your results in this case even more than I did in the Jefferson Hope Murder,0.5,0.5
The thing seems to me to be deeper and more inexplicable,-0.04999999999999999,0.7
How for example could you describe with such confidence the wooden-legged man ” “ Pshaw my dear boy,0.0,0.5
it was simplicity itself,0.0,0.0
I don ’ t wish to be theatrical,0.0,0.0
It is all patent and above-board,0.0,0.0
Two officers who are in command of a convict-guard learn an important secret as to buried treasure,0.0,0.85
A map is drawn for them by an Englishman named Jonathan Small,-0.25,0.4
You remember that we saw the name upon the chart in Captain Morstan ’ s possession,0.0,0.0
He had signed it in behalf of himself and his associates —the sign of the four as he somewhat dramatically called it,0.0,0.0
Aided by this chart the officers—or one of them—gets the treasure and brings it to England leaving we will suppose some condition under which he received it unfulfilled,0.0,0.0
Now then why did not Jonathan Small get the treasure himself,-0.25,0.4
The answer is obvious,0.0,0.5
The chart is dated at a time when Morstan was brought into close association with convicts,0.0,0.0
Jonathan Small did not get the treasure because he and his associates were themselves convicts and could not get away ” “ But that is mere speculation ” said I,-0.375,0.45
“ It is more than that,0.5,0.5
It is the only hypothesis which covers the facts,0.0,1.0
Let us see how it fits in with the sequel,0.0,0.0
Major Sholto remains at peace for some years happy in the possession of his treasure,0.43125,0.75
Then he receives a letter from India which gives him a great fright,0.8,0.75
What was that ” “ A letter to say that the men whom he had wronged had been set free ” “ Or had escaped,0.4,0.8
That is much more likely for he would have known what their term of imprisonment was,0.25,0.75
It would not have been a surprise to him,0.0,0.0
What does he do then,0.0,0.0
He guards himself against a wooden-legged man —a white man mark you for he mistakes a white tradesman for him and actually fires a pistol at him,0.0,0.03333333333333333
Now only one white man ’ s name is on the chart,0.0,0.5
The others are Hindoos or Mohammedans,0.0,0.0
There is no other white man,0.03125,0.1875
Therefore we may say with confidence that the wooden-legged man is identical with Jonathan Small,-0.25,0.4
Does the reasoning strike you as being faulty ” “ No it is clear and concise ” “ Well now let us put ourselves in the place of Jonathan Small,-0.016666666666666663,0.4611111111111111
Let us look at it from his point of view,0.0,0.0
He comes to England with the double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and of having his revenge upon the man who had wronged him,0.0,0.0
He found out where Sholto lived and very possibly he established communications with some one inside the house,0.0,1.0
There is this butler Lal Rao whom we have not seen,0.0,0.0
Mrs Bernstone gives him far from a good character,0.39999999999999997,0.8
Small could not find out however where the treasure was hid for no one ever knew save the major and one faithful servant who had died,-0.09375,0.45
Suddenly Small learns that the major is on his death-bed,-0.09375,0.45
In a frenzy lest the secret of the treasure die with him he runs the gauntlet of the guards makes his way to the dying man ’ s window and is only deterred from entering by the presence of his two sons,-0.2,0.85
Mad with hate however against the dead man he enters the room that night searches his private papers in the hope of discovering some memorandum relating to the treasure and finally leaves a momento of his visit in the short inscription upon the card,-0.2708333333333333,0.6625
He had doubtless planned beforehand that should he slay the major he would leave some such record upon the body as a sign that it was not a common murder but from the point of view of the four associates something in the nature of an act of justice,0.07083333333333333,0.5
Whimsical and bizarre conceits of this kind are common enough in the annals of crime and usually afford valuable indications as to the criminal,-0.0642857142857143,0.5428571428571428
Do you follow all this ” “ Very clearly ” “ Now what could Jonathan Small do,-0.059999999999999984,0.44916666666666666
He could only continue to keep a secret watch upon the efforts made to find the treasure,-0.2,0.85
Possibly he leaves England and only comes back at intervals,0.0,0.6666666666666666
Then comes the discovery of the garret and he is instantly informed of it,0.0,0.6666666666666666
We again trace the presence of some confederate in the household,0.0,0.0
Jonathan with his wooden leg is utterly unable to reach the lofty room of Bartholomew Sholto,-0.25,0.25
He takes with him however a rather curious associate who gets over this difficulty but dips his naked foot into creasote whence comes Toby and a six-mile limp for a half-pay officer with a damaged tendo Achillis ” “ But it was the associate and not Jonathan who committed the crime ” “ Quite so,-0.10000000000000002,0.6333333333333333
And rather to Jonathan ’ s disgust to judge by the way he stamped about when he got into the room,0.0,0.0
He bore no grudge against Bartholomew Sholto and would have preferred if he could have been simply bound and gagged,0.0,0.35714285714285715
He did not wish to put his head in a halter,0.0,0.0
There was no help for it however the savage instincts of his companion had broken out and the poison had done its work so Jonathan Small left his record lowered the treasure-box to the ground and followed it himself,-0.21666666666666667,0.26666666666666666
That was the train of events as far as I can decipher them,0.1,1.0
Of course as to his personal appearance he must be middle-aged and must be sunburned after serving his time in such an oven as the Andamans,0.0,0.4
His height is readily calculated from the length of his stride and we know that he was bearded,0.2,0.5
His hairiness was the one point which impressed itself upon Thaddeus Sholto when he saw him at the window,1.0,1.0
I don ’ t know that there is anything else ” “ The associate ” “ Ah well there is no great mystery in that,-0.4,0.75
But you will know all about it soon enough,0.0,0.5
How sweet the morning air is,0.4375,0.65
See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo,-0.14375,0.4
Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank,0.0,0.0
It shines on a good many folk but on none I dare bet who are on a stranger errand than you and I,0.6,0.55
How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of nature,0.375,0.575
Are you well up in your Jean Paul ” “ Fairly so,0.7,0.9
I worked back to him through Carlyle ” “ That was like following the brook to the parent lake,0.0,0.05
He makes one curious but profound remark,-0.008333333333333338,1.0
It is that the chief proof of man ’ s real greatness lies in his perception of his own smallness,0.4,0.65
It argues you see a power of comparison and of appreciation which is in itself a proof of nobility,0.0,0.0
There is much food for thought in Richter,0.2,0.2
You have not a pistol have you ” “ I have my stick ” “ It is just possible that we may need something of the sort if we get to their lair,0.0,1.0
Jonathan I shall leave to you but if the other turns nasty I shall shoot him dead ” He took out his revolver as he spoke and having loaded two of the chambers he put it back into the right-hand pocket of his jacket,-0.33125,0.44375
We had during this time been following the guidance of Toby down the half-rural villa-lined roads which lead to the metropolis,-0.07777777777777779,0.19444444444444448
Now however we were beginning to come among continuous streets where labourers and dockmen were already astir and slatternly women were taking down shutters and brushing door-steps,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
At the square-topped corner public houses business was just beginning and rough-looking men were emerging rubbing their sleeves across their beards after their morning wet,-0.05,0.23333333333333334
Strange dogs sauntered up and stared wonderingly at us as we passed but our inimitable Toby looked neither to the right nor to the left but trotted onwards with his nose to the ground and an occasional eager whine which spoke of a hot scent,0.09714285714285714,0.3321428571428572
We had traversed Streatham Brixton Camberwell and now found ourselves in Kennington Lane having borne away through the side-streets to the east of the Oval,0.0,0.0
The men whom we pursued seemed to have taken a curiously zigzag road with the idea probably of escaping observation,-0.1,1.0
They had never kept to the main road if a parallel side-street would serve their turn,0.08333333333333333,0.16666666666666666
At the foot of Kennington Lane they had edged away to the left through Bond Street and Miles Street,0.0,0.0
Where the latter street turns into Knight ’ s Place Toby ceased to advance but began to run backwards and forwards with one ear cocked and the other drooping the very picture of canine indecision,0.025000000000000005,0.225
Then he waddled round in circles looking up to us from time to time as if to ask for sympathy in his embarrassment,-0.2,0.4
“ What the deuce is the matter with the dog ” growled Holmes,0.0,0.0
“ They surely would not take a cab or go off in a balloon ” “ Perhaps they stood here for some time ” I suggested,0.5,0.8888888888888888
“ Ah,0.0,0.0
it ’ s all right,0.2857142857142857,0.5357142857142857
He ’ s off again ” said my companion in a tone of relief,0.0,0.0
He was indeed off for after sniffing round again he suddenly made up his mind and darted away with an energy and determination such as he had not yet shown,-0.06666666666666667,0.4666666666666666
The scent appeared to be much hotter than before for he had not even to put his nose on the ground but tugged at his leash and tried to break into a run,0.2,0.2
I cold see by the gleam in Holmes ’ s eyes that he thought we were nearing the end of our journey,-0.6,1.0
Our course now ran down Nine Elms until we came to Broderick and Nelson ’ s large timber-yard just past the White Eagle tavern,-0.04781746031746033,0.24186507936507937
Here the dog frantic with excitement turned down through the side-gate into the enclosure where the sawyers were already at work,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
On the dog raced through sawdust and shavings down an alley round a passage between two wood-piles and finally with a triumphant yelp sprang upon a large barrel which still stood upon the hand-trolley on which it had been brought,-0.03531746031746034,0.5293650793650794
With lolling tongue and blinking eyes Toby stood upon the cask looking from one to the other of us for some sign of appreciation,-0.125,0.375
The staves of the barrel and the wheels of the trolley were smeared with a dark liquid and the whole air was heavy with the smell of creasote,-0.049999999999999996,0.43333333333333335
Sherlock Holmes and I looked blankly at each other and then burst simultaneously into an uncontrollable fit of laughter,0.09166666666666667,0.25833333333333336
Chapter VIII The Baker Street Irregulars “ What now ” I asked,0.0,0.0
“ Toby has lost his character for infallibility ” “ He acted according to his lights ” said Holmes lifting him down from the barrel and walking him out of the timber-yard,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
“ If you consider how much creasote is carted about London in one day it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed,-0.1,0.475
It is much used now especially for the seasoning of wood,0.1,0.6
Poor Toby is not to blame ” “ We must get on the main scent again I suppose ” “ Yes,-0.11666666666666668,0.4666666666666667
And fortunately we have no distance to go,0.4,0.7
Evidently what puzzled the dog at the corner of Knight ’ s Place was that there were two different trails running in opposite directions,0.08333333333333333,0.2833333333333333
We took the wrong one,-0.5,0.9
It only remains to follow the other ” There was no difficulty about this,-0.0625,0.6875
On leading Toby to the place where he had committed his fault he cast about in a wide circle and finally dashed off in a fresh direction,0.06666666666666667,0.6333333333333333
“ We must take care that he does not now bring us to the place where the creasote-barrel came from ” I observed,0.0,0.0
“ I had thought of that,0.0,0.0
But you notice that he keeps on the pavement whereas the barrel passed down the roadway,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
No we are on the true scent now ” It tended down towards the river-side running through Belmont Place and Prince ’ s Street,0.0972222222222222,0.46944444444444444
At the end of Broad Street it ran right down to the water ’ s edge where there was a small wooden wharf,-0.011468253968253978,0.3074206349206349
Toby led us to the very edge of this and there stood whining looking out on the dark current beyond,0.016666666666666673,0.3666666666666667
“ We are out of luck ” said Holmes,0.0,0.0
“ They have taken to a boat here ” Several small punts and skiffs were lying about in the water and on the edge of the wharf,-0.125,0.2
We took Toby round to each in turn but though he sniffed earnestly he made no sign,-0.2,0.4
Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house with a wooden placard slung out through the second window,-0.1375,0.25
“ Mordecai Smith ” was printed across it in large letters and underneath “ Boats to hire by the hour or day ” A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept —a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty,0.28285714285714286,0.4557142857142857
Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round and his face assumed an ominous expression,-0.2,0.4
“ This looks bad ” said he,-0.6999999999999998,0.6666666666666666
“ These fellows are sharper than I expected,-0.1,0.4
They seem to have covered their tracks,0.0,0.0
There has I fear been preconcerted management here ” He was approaching the door of the house when it opened and a little curly-headed lad of six came running out followed by a stoutish red-faced woman with a large sponge in her hand,0.008928571428571425,0.30952380952380953
“ You come back and be washed Jack ” she shouted,0.0,0.0
“ Come back you young imp for if your father comes home and finds you like that he ’ ll let us hear of it ” “ Dear little chap ” said Holmes strategically,-0.04479166666666667,0.3
“ What a rosy-cheeked young rascal,0.125,0.4
Now Jack is there anything you would like ” The youth pondered for a moment,0.0,0.0
“ I ’ d like a shillin ’ ” said he,0.0,0.0
“ Nothing you would like better ” “ I ’ d like two shillin ’ better ” the prodigy answered after some thought,0.5,0.5

Catch —A fine child Mrs Smith ” “ Lor ’ bless you sir he is that and forward,0.5208333333333334,0.5
He gets a ’ most too much for me to manage ’ specially when my man is away days at a time ” “ Away is he ” said Holmes in a disappointed voice,0.07678571428571429,0.5053571428571428
“ I am sorry for that for I wanted to speak to Mr Smith ” “ He ’ s been away since yesterday mornin ’ sir and truth to tell I am beginnin ’ to feel frightened about him,-0.5,1.0
But if it was about a boat sir maybe I could serve as well ” “ I wanted to hire his steam launch ” “ Why bless you sir it is in the steam launch that he has gone,0.0,0.0
That ’ s what puzzles me for I know there ain ’ t more coals in her than would take her to about Woolwich and back,0.25,0.25
If he ’ d been away in the barge I ’ d ha ’ thought nothin ’ for many a time a job has taken him as far as Gravesend and then if there was much doin ’ there he might ha ’ stayed over,0.26666666666666666,0.5666666666666667
But what good is a steam launch without coals ” “ He might have bought some at a wharf down the river ” “ He might sir but it weren ’ t his way,0.2722222222222222,0.44444444444444453
Many a time I ’ ve heard him call out at the prices they charge for a few odd bags,0.044444444444444446,0.2833333333333333
Besides I don ’ t like that wooden-legged man wi ’ his ugly face and outlandish talk,-0.7,1.0
What did he want always knockin ’ about here for ” “ A wooden-legged man ” said Holmes with bland surprise,-0.16666666666666666,0.8333333333333334
“ Yes sir a brown monkey-faced chap that ’ s called more ’ n once for my old man,0.3,0.35
It was him that roused him up yesternight and what ’ s more my man knew he was comin ’ for he had steam up in the launch,0.5,0.5
I tell you straight sir I don ’ t feel easy in my mind about it ” “ But my dear Mrs Smith ” said Holmes shrugging his shoulders “ You are frightening yourself about nothing,0.04444444444444443,0.7444444444444445
How could you possibly tell that it was the wooden-legged man who came in the night,0.0,1.0
I don ’ t quite understand how you can be so sure ” “ His voice sir,0.5,0.8888888888888888
I knew his voice which is kind o ’ thick and foggy,0.14999999999999997,0.6875
He tapped at the winder —about three it would be,0.0,0.0
‘ Show a leg matey ’ says he ‘ time to turn out guard ’ My old man woke up Jim —that ’ s my eldest —and away they went without so much as a word to me,0.15000000000000002,0.2
I could hear the wooden leg clackin ’ on the stones ” “ And was this wooden-legged man alone ” “ Couldn ’ t say I am sure sir,0.25,0.4444444444444444
I didn ’ t hear no one else ” “ I am sorry Mrs Smith for I wanted a steam launch and I have heard good reports of the—Let me see what is her name ” “ The Aurora sir ” “ Ah,0.1875,0.8
She ’ s not that old green launch with a yellow line very broad in the beam ” “ No indeed,-0.004687500000000001,0.2265625
She ’ s as trim a little thing as any on the river,-0.1875,0.5
She ’ s been fresh painted black with two red streaks ” “ Thanks,0.08333333333333334,0.2833333333333333
I hope that you will hear soon from Mr Smith,0.0,0.0
I am going down the river and if I should see anything of the Aurora I shall let him know that you are uneasy,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
A black funnel you say ” “ No sir,-0.16666666666666666,0.43333333333333335
Black with a white band ” “ Ah of course,-0.08333333333333333,0.21666666666666667
It was the sides which were black,-0.16666666666666666,0.43333333333333335
Good-morning Mrs Smith.—There is a boatman here with a wherry Watson,0.0,0.0
We shall take it and cross the river,0.0,0.0
“ The main thing with people of that sort ” said Holmes as we sat in the sheets of the wherry “ is never to let them think that their information can be of the slightest importance to you,0.16666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
If you do they will instantly shut up like an oyster,0.0,0.6666666666666666
If you listen to them under protest as it were you are very likely to get what you want ” “ Our course now seems pretty clear ” said I,0.11666666666666668,0.7944444444444444
“ What would you do then ” “ I would engage a launch and go down the river on the track of the Aurora ” “ My dear fellow it would be a colossal task,0.0722222222222222,0.5444444444444445
She may have touched at any wharf on either side of the stream between here and Greenwich,0.0,0.0
Below the bridge there is a perfect labyrinth of landing-places for miles,1.0,1.0
It would take you days and days to exhaust them if you set about it alone ” “ Employ the police then ” “ No,0.0,0.0
I shall probably call Athelney Jones in at the last moment,0.0,0.06666666666666667
He is not a bad fellow and I should not like to do anything which would injure him professionally,0.22499999999999998,0.3833333333333333
But I have a fancy for working it out myself now that we have gone so far ” “ Could we advertise then asking for information from wharfingers ” “ Worse and worse,-0.26666666666666666,0.7333333333333334
Our men would know that the chase was hot at their heels and they would be off out of the country,0.25,0.8500000000000001
As it is they are likely enough to leave but as long as they think they are perfectly safe they will be in no hurry,0.1125,0.6
Jones ’ s energy will be of use to us there for his view of the case is sure to push itself into the daily press and the runaways will think that every one is off on the wrong scent ” “ What are we to do then ” I asked as we landed near Millbank Penitentiary,0.025,0.5472222222222222
“ Take this hansom drive home have some breakfast and get an hour ’ s sleep,0.0,0.0
It is quite on the cards that we may be afoot to-night again,0.0,0.0
Stop at a telegraph-office cabby,0.0,0.0
We will keep Toby for he may be of use to us yet ” We pulled up at the Great Peter Street post-office and Holmes despatched his wire,0.8,0.75
“ Whom do you think that is to ” he asked as we resumed our journey,0.0,0.0
“ I am sure I don ’ t know ” “ You remember the Baker Street division of the detective police force whom I employed in the Jefferson Hope case ” “ Well ” said I laughing,0.5,0.8888888888888888

That wire was to my dirty little lieutenant Wiggins and I expect that he and his gang will be with us before we have finished our breakfast ” It was between eight and nine o ’ clock now and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night,-0.06354166666666668,0.6333333333333333
I was limp and weary befogged in mind and fatigued in body,-0.2,0.5
I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem,-0.03333333333333335,0.3333333333333333
As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went I had heard little good of him and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers,0.128125,0.775
The treasure however was a different matter,0.0,0.6
That or part of it belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan,0.0,0.0
While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object,0.2,0.5
True if I found it it would probably put her forever beyond my reach,0.35,0.65
Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that,0.0,0.7000000000000001
If Holmes could work to find the criminals I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure,0.0,0.0
A bath at Baker Street and a complete change freshened me up wonderfully,0.55,0.7
When I came down to our room I found the breakfast laid and Homes pouring out the coffee,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
“ Here it is ” said he laughing and pointing to an open newspaper,0.0,0.5
“ The energetic Jones and the ubiquitous reporter have fixed it up between them,0.3,0.35
But you have had enough of the case,0.0,0.5
Better have your ham and eggs first ” I took the paper from him and read the short notice which was headed “ Mysterious Business at Upper Norwood ” “ About twelve o ’ clock last night ” said the Standard “ Mr,0.10714285714285714,0.31428571428571433
Bartholomew Sholto of Pondicherry Lodge Upper Norwood was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play,-0.1,0.2
As far as we can learn no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr Sholto ’ s person but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off,0.05,0.55
The discovery was first made by Mr Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson who had called at the house with Mr Thaddeus Sholto brother of the deceased,0.25,0.3333333333333333
By a singular piece of good fortune Mr Athelney Jones the well-known member of the detective police force happened to be at the Norwood Police Station and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm,0.2611111111111111,0.3666666666666667
His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals with the gratifying result that the brother Thaddeus Sholto has already been arrested together with the housekeeper Mrs Bernstone an Indian butler named Lal Rao and a porter or gatekeeper named McMurdo,0.8,0.9
It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house for Mr Jones ’ s well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window but must have made their way across the roof of the building and so through a trap-door into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found,0.2380952380952381,0.4238095238095238
This fact which has been very clearly made out proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary,0.020000000000000018,0.44958333333333333
The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind,0.38809523809523805,0.5107142857142858
We can not but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralised and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate ” “ Isn ’ t it gorgeous ” said Holmes grinning over his coffee-cup,0.61875,0.675
“ What do you think of it ” “ I think that we have had a close shave ourselves of being arrested for the crime ” “ So do I I wouldn ’ t answer for our safety now if he should happen to have another of his attacks of energy ” At this moment there was a loud ring at the bell and I could hear Mrs Hudson our landlady raising her voice in a wail of expostulation and dismay,0.1,0.8
“ By heaven Holmes ” I said half rising “ I believe that they are really after us ” “ No it ’ s not quite so bad as that,-0.22222222222222218,0.3444444444444444
It is the unofficial force —the Baker Street irregulars ” As he spoke there came a swift pattering of naked feet upon the stairs a clatter of high voices and in rushed a dozen dirty and ragged little street-Arabs,-0.156875,0.56
There was some show of discipline among them despite their tumultuous entry for they instantly drew up in line and stood facing us with expectant faces,0.0,0.6666666666666666

At Camberwell I found Miss Morstan a little weary after her night ’ s adventures but very eager to hear the news,0.0062500000000000056,0.4
Mrs Forrester too was full of curiosity,0.35,0.55

“ Nothing else is of any consequence but I think that he has behaved most kindly and honourably throughout,0.55,0.7

But surely surely we shall hear something ” We did not however,0.5,0.8888888888888888
Not a word came to us either from Wiggins or from the other agencies,-0.125,0.375
There were articles in most of the papers upon the Norwood tragedy,0.5,0.5
They all appeared to be rather hostile to the unfortunate Thaddeus Sholto,-0.5,1.0
No fresh details were to be found however in any of them save that an inquest was to be held upon the following day,-0.075,0.3
I walked over to Camberwell in the evening to report our ill success to the ladies and on my return I found Holmes dejected and somewhat morose,-0.1,0.5
He would hardly reply to my questions and busied himself all evening in an abstruse chemical analysis which involved much heating of retorts and distilling of vapours ending at last in a smell which fairly drove me out of the apartment,0.15208333333333332,0.42708333333333337
Up to the small hours of the morning I could hear the clinking of his test-tubes which told me that he was still engaged in his malodorous experiment,-0.25,0.4
In the early dawn I woke with a start and was surprised to find him standing by my bedside clad in a rude sailor dress with a pea-jacket and a coarse red scarf round his neck,-0.049999999999999996,0.44999999999999996
“ I am off down the river Watson ” said he,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889

If I am in luck however I may not be gone so very long,-0.065,0.52
I shall have news of some sort or other before I get back ” I had heard nothing of him by breakfast-time,-0.0625,0.1875
On opening the Standard however I found that there was a fresh allusion to the business,0.15,0.25
“ With reference to the Upper Norwood tragedy ” it remarked “ we have reason to believe that the matter promises to be even more complex and mysterious than was originally supposed,0.11499999999999999,0.53
Fresh evidence has shown that it is quite impossible that Mr Thaddeus Sholto could have been in any way concerned in the matter,-0.18333333333333332,0.75
He and the housekeeper Mrs Bernstone were both released yesterday evening,0.0,0.0
It is believed however that the police have a clue as to the real culprits and that it is being prosecuted by Mr Athelney Jones of Scotland Yard with all his well-known energy and sagacity,0.2,0.30000000000000004
Further arrests may be expected at any moment ” “ That is satisfactory so far as it goes ” thought I,0.0,0.6333333333333333
“ Friend Sholto is safe at any rate,0.5,0.5
I wonder what the fresh clue may be though it seems to be a stereotyped form whenever the police have made a blunder ” I tossed the paper down upon the table but at that moment my eye caught an advertisement in the agony column,0.0148148148148148,0.562962962962963
It ran in this way “ Lost.—Whereas Mordecai Smith boatman and his son Jim left Smith ’ s Wharf at or about three o ’ clock last Tuesday morning in the steam launch Aurora black with two red stripes funnel black with a white band the sum of five pounds will be paid to any one who can give information to Mrs Smith at Smith ’ s Wharf or at 221_b Baker Street as to the whereabouts of the said Mordecai Smith and the launch Aurora ” This was clearly Holmes ’ s doing,-0.033333333333333326,0.1880952380952381
The Baker Street address was enough to prove that,0.0,0.5
It struck me as rather ingenious because it might be read by the fugitives without their seeing in it more than the natural anxiety of a wife for her missing husband,0.22500000000000003,0.4875
It was a long day,-0.05,0.4
Every time that a knock came to the door or a sharp step passed in the street I imagined that it was either Holmes returning or an answer to his advertisement,-0.125,0.75
I tried to read but my thoughts would wander off to our strange quest and to the ill-assorted and villainous pair whom we were pursuing,-0.05,0.15
Could there be I wondered some radical flaw in my companion ’ s reasoning,0.0,0.0
Might he be suffering from some huge self-deception,0.4000000000000001,0.9
Was it not possible that his nimble and speculative mind had built up this wild theory upon faulty premises,0.05,0.7
I had never known him to be wrong and yet the keenest reasoner may occasionally be deceived,-0.25,0.5125
He was likely I thought to fall into error through the over-refinement of his logic —his preference for a subtle and bizarre explanation when a plainer and more commonplace one lay ready to his hand,0.15333333333333332,0.62
Yet on the other hand I had myself seen the evidence and I had heard the reasons for his deductions,-0.125,0.375
When I looked back on the long chain of curious circumstances many of them trivial in themselves but all tending in the same direction I could not disguise from myself that even if Holmes ’ s explanation were incorrect the true theory must be equally outré and startling,0.024999999999999994,0.428125
At three o ’ clock in the afternoon there was a loud peal at the bell an authoritative voice in the hall and to my surprise no less a person than Mr Athelney Jones was shown up to me,0.16111111111111112,0.5888888888888889
Very different was he however from the brusque and masterful professor of common sense who had taken over the case so confidently at Upper Norwood,0.175,0.5700000000000001
His expression was downcast and his bearing meek and even apologetic,0.0,0.0
“ Good-day sir good-day ” said he,0.0,0.0
“ Mr,0.0,0.0
Sherlock Holmes is out I understand ” “ Yes and I can not be sure when he will be back,0.25,0.4444444444444444
But perhaps you would care to wait,0.0,0.0
Take that chair and try one of these cigars ” “ Thank you I don ’ t mind if I do ” said he mopping his face with a red bandanna handkerchief,0.0,0.0
“ And a whiskey-and-soda ” “ Well half a glass,-0.16666666666666666,0.16666666666666666
It is very hot for the time of year and I have had a good deal to worry and try me,0.5125,0.8
You know my theory about this Norwood case ” “ I remember that you expressed one ” “ Well I have been obliged to reconsider it,0.0,0.0
I had my net drawn tightly round Mr Sholto sir when pop he went through a hole in the middle of it,-0.06666666666666667,0.13333333333333333
He was able to prove an alibi which could not be shaken,0.5,0.625
From the time that he left his brother ’ s room he was never out of sight of some one or other,-0.0625,0.1875
So it could not be he who climbed over roofs and through trap-doors,0.0,0.0
It ’ s a very dark case and my professional credit is at stake,-0.0475,0.31
I should be very glad of a little assistance ” “ We all need help sometimes ” said I,0.23125,0.75
“ Your friend Mr Sherlock Holmes is a wonderful man sir ” said he in a husky and confidential voice,1.0,1.0
“ He ’ s a man who is not to be beat,0.0,0.0
I have known that young man go into a good many cases but I never saw the case yet that he could not throw a light upon,0.42499999999999993,0.55
He is irregular in his methods and a little quick perhaps in jumping at theories but on the whole I think he would have made a most promising officer and I don ’ t care who knows it,0.20916666666666667,0.48
I have had a wire from him this morning by which I understand that he has got some clue to this Sholto business,0.0,0.0
Here is the message ” He took the telegram out of his pocket and handed it to me,0.0,0.0
It was dated from Poplar at twelve o ’ clock,0.0,0.0
“ Go to Baker Street at once ” it said,0.0,0.0
“ If I have not returned wait for me,0.0,0.0
I am close on the track of the Sholto gang,0.0,0.0
You can come with us to-night if you want to be in at the finish ” “ This sounds well,0.0,0.0
He has evidently picked up the scent again ” said I,0.25,0.25
“ Ah then he has been at fault too ” exclaimed Jones with evident satisfaction,0.25,0.25
“ Even the best of us are thrown off sometimes,1.0,0.3
Of course this may prove to be a false alarm but it is my duty as an officer of the law to allow no chance to slip,-0.4000000000000001,0.6
But there is some one at the door,0.0,0.0
Perhaps this is he ” A heavy step was heard ascending the stair with a great wheezing and rattling as from a man who was sorely put to it for breath,0.30000000000000004,0.625
Once or twice he stopped as though the climb were too much for him but at last he made his way to our door and entered,0.1,0.13333333333333333
His appearance corresponded to the sounds which we had heard,0.0,0.0
He was an aged man clad in seafaring garb with an old pea-jacket buttoned up to his throat,0.0,0.30000000000000004
His back was bowed his knees were shaky and his breathing was painfully asthmatic,-0.3444444444444444,0.4666666666666666
As he leaned upon a thick oaken cudgel his shoulders heaved in the effort to draw the air into his lungs,-0.30000000000000004,0.475
He had a coloured scarf round his chin and I could see little of his face save a pair of keen dark eyes overhung by bushy white brows and long grey side-whiskers,-0.10625000000000001,0.30000000000000004
Altogether he gave me the impression of a respectable master mariner who had fallen into years and poverty,0.5,0.5
“ What is it my man ” I asked,0.0,0.0
He looked about him in the slow methodical fashion of old age,-0.10000000000000002,0.3
“ Is Mr Sherlock Holmes here ” said he,0.0,0.0
“ No but I am acting for him,0.0,0.0
You can tell me any message you have for him ” “ It was to him himself I was to tell it ” said he,0.0,0.0
“ But I tell you that I am acting for him,0.0,0.0
Was it about Mordecai Smith ’ s boat ” “ Yes,0.0,0.0
I knows well where it is,0.0,0.0
An ’ I knows where the men he is after are,0.0,0.0
An ’ I knows where the treasure is,0.0,0.0
I knows all about it ” “ Then tell me and I shall let him know ” “ It was to him I was to tell it ” he repeated with the petulant obstinacy of a very old man,0.13,0.26
“ Well you must wait for him ” “ No no I ain ’ t goin ’ to lose a whole day to please no one,0.2,0.4
If Mr Holmes ain ’ t here then Mr Holmes must find it all out for himself,0.0,0.0
I don ’ t care about the look of either of you and I won ’ t tell a word ” He shuffled towards the door but Athelney Jones got in front of him,0.0,0.0
“ Wait a bit my friend ” said he,0.0,0.0
“ You have important information and you must not walk off,0.4,1.0
We shall keep you whether you like or not until our friend returns ” The old man made a little run towards the door but as Athelney Jones put his broad back up against it he recognised the uselessness of resistance,-0.006249999999999999,0.253125
“ Pretty sort o ’ treatment this ” he cried stamping his stick,0.3125,1.0
“ I come here to see a gentleman and you two who I never saw in my life seize me and treat me in this fashion ” “ You will be none the worse ” I said,-0.4,0.6
“ We shall recompense you for the loss of your time,0.0,0.0
Sit over here on the sofa and you will not have long to wait ” He came across sullenly enough and seated himself with his face resting on his hands,-0.025,0.45
Jones and I resumed our cigars and our talk,0.0,0.0
Suddenly however Holmes ’ s voice broke in upon us,0.0,0.5
“ I think that you might offer me a cigar too ” he said,0.0,0.0
We both started in our chairs,0.0,0.0
There was Holmes sitting close to us with an air of quiet amusement,0.0,0.3333333333333333
“ Holmes ” I exclaimed,0.0,0.0
“ You here,0.0,0.0
But where is the old man ” “ Here is the old man ” said he holding out a heap of white hair,0.06666666666666667,0.13333333333333333
“ Here he is —wig whiskers eyebrows and all,0.0,0.0
I thought my disguise was pretty good but I hardly expected that it would stand that test ” “ Ah You rogue ” cried Jones highly delighted,0.38125,0.675
“ You would have made an actor and a rare one,0.3,0.9
You had the proper workhouse cough and those weak legs of yours are worth ten pounds a week,-0.018750000000000003,0.20625
I thought I knew the glint of your eye though,0.0,0.0
You didn ’ t get away from us so easily You see ” “ I have been working in that get-up all day ” said he lighting his cigar,0.43333333333333335,0.8333333333333334
“ You see a good many of the criminal classes begin to know me —especially since our friend here took to publishing some of my cases so I can only go on the war-path under some simple disguise like this,0.15999999999999998,0.6014285714285715
You got my wire ” “ Yes that was what brought me here ” “ How has your case prospered ” “ It has all come to nothing,0.0,0.0
I have had to release two of my prisoners and there is no evidence against the other two ” “ Never mind,-0.125,0.375
We shall give you two others in the place of them,0.0,0.0
But you must put yourself under my orders,0.0,0.0
You are welcome to all the official credit but you must act on the line that I point out,0.8,0.9
Is that agreed ” “ Entirely if you will help me to the men ” “ Well then in the first place I shall want a fast police-boat—a steam launch—to be at the Westminster Stairs at seven o ’ clock ” “ That is easily managed,0.22083333333333333,0.5979166666666667
There is always one about there but I can step across the road and telephone to make sure ” “ Then I shall want two stanch men in case of resistance ” “ There will be two or three in the boat,0.5,0.8888888888888888
What else ” “ When we secure the men we shall get the treasure,0.4,0.6
I think that it would be a pleasure to my friend here to take the box round to the young lady to whom half of it rightfully belongs,-0.08888888888888889,0.32222222222222224
Let her be the first to open it.—Eh Watson ” “ It would be a great pleasure to me ” “ Rather an irregular proceeding ” said Jones shaking his head,0.35000000000000003,0.5277777777777778
“ However the whole thing is irregular and I suppose we must wink at it,0.2,0.4
The treasure must afterwards be handed over to the authorities until after the official investigation ” “ Certainly,0.21428571428571427,0.5714285714285714
That is easily managed,0.43333333333333335,0.8333333333333334
One other point,-0.125,0.375
I should much like to have a few details about this matter from the lips of Jonathan Small himself,-0.08333333333333333,0.23333333333333336
You know I like to work the detail of my cases out,0.0,0.0
There is no objection to my having an unofficial interview with him either here in my rooms or elsewhere as long as he is efficiently guarded ” “ Well you are master of the situation,0.17500000000000002,0.5
I have had no proof yet of the existence of this Jonathan Small,-0.25,0.4
However if you can catch him I don ’ t see how I can refuse you an interview with him ” “ That is understood then ” “ Perfectly,1.0,1.0
Is there anything else ” “ Only that I insist upon your dining with us,0.0,1.0
It will be ready in half an hour,0.016666666666666677,0.3333333333333333
I have oysters and a brace of grouse with something a little choice in white wines.—Watson you have never yet recognised my merits as a housekeeper ” Chapter X The End of the Islander Our meal was a merry one,-0.09375,0.25
Holmes could talk exceedingly well when he chose and that night he did choose,0.0,0.0
He appeared to be in a state of nervous exaltation,0.0,0.0
I have never known him so brilliant,0.9,1.0
He spoke on a quick succession of subjects —on miracle-plays on mediæval pottery on Stradivarius violins on the Buddhism of Ceylon and on the war-ships of the future —handling each as though he had made a special study of it,0.34523809523809523,0.5357142857142857
His bright humour marked the reaction from his black depression of the preceding days,0.21111111111111114,0.611111111111111
Athelney Jones proved to be a sociable soul in his hours of relaxation and faced his dinner with the air of a bon vivant,0.0,0.0
For myself I felt elated at the thought that we were nearing the end of our task and I caught something of Holmes ’ s gaiety,0.0,0.0
None of us alluded during dinner to the cause which had brought us together,0.0,0.0
When the cloth was cleared Holmes glanced at his watch and filled up three glasses with port,0.4,0.9
“ One bumper ” said he “ to the success of our little expedition,0.056249999999999994,0.25
And now it is high time we were off,0.16,0.5399999999999999
Have you a pistol Watson ” “ I have my old service-revolver in my desk ” “ You had best take it then,0.55,0.25
It is well to be prepared,0.0,0.0
I see that the cab is at the door,0.0,0.0
I ordered it for half-past six ” It was a little past seven before we reached the Westminster wharf and found our launch awaiting us,-0.21875,0.375
Holmes eyed it critically,0.0,0.8
“ Is there anything to mark it as a police-boat ” “ Yes —that green lamp at the side ” “ Then take it off ” The small change was made we stepped on board and the ropes were cast off,-0.225,0.35
Jones Holmes and I sat in the stern,0.0,0.0
There was one man at the rudder one to tend the engines and two burly police-inspectors forward,0.0,0.0
“ Where to ” asked Jones,0.0,0.0
“ To the Tower,0.0,0.0
Tell them to stop opposite Jacobson ’ s Yard ” Our craft was evidently a very fast one,0.13,0.39
We shot past the long lines of loaded barges as though they were stationary,-0.15,0.325
Holmes smiled with satisfaction as we overhauled a river steamer and left her behind us,0.06666666666666665,0.3
“ We ought to be able to catch anything on the river ” he said,0.5,0.625
“ Well hardly that,-0.2916666666666667,0.5416666666666666
But there are not many launches to beat us ” “ We shall have to catch the Aurora and she has a name for being a clipper,-0.25,0.5
I will tell you how the land lies Watson,0.0,0.0
You recollect how annoyed I was at being balked by so small a thing ” “ Yes ” “ Well I gave my mind a thorough rest by plunging into a chemical analysis,-0.325,0.6000000000000001
One of our greatest statesmen has said that a change of work is the best rest,1.0,0.65
So it is,0.0,0.0
When I had succeeded in dissolving the hydrocarbon which I was at work at I came back to our problem of the Sholtos and thought the whole matter out again,0.1,0.2
My boys had been up the river and down the river without result,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
The launch was not at any landing-stage or wharf nor had it returned,0.0,0.0
Yet it could hardly have been scuttled to hide their traces —though that always remained as a possible hypothesis if all else failed,-0.2638888888888889,0.6138888888888888
I knew this man Small had a certain degree of low cunning but I did not think him capable of anything in the nature of delicate finesse,-0.02261904761904762,0.5452380952380952
That is usually a product of higher education,0.0,0.375
I then reflected that since he had certainly been in London some time—as we had evidence that he maintained a continual watch over Pondicherry Lodge—he could hardly leave at a moment ’ s notice but would need some little time if it were only a day to arrange his affairs,-0.06622023809523811,0.6532738095238095
That was the balance of probability at any rate ” “ It seems to me to be a little weak ” said I,-0.28125,0.5625
“ It is more probable that he had arranged his affairs before ever he set out upon his expedition ” “ No I hardly think so,0.3229166666666667,0.5208333333333333
This lair of his would be too valuable a retreat in case of need for him to give it up until he was sure that he could do without it,0.5,0.8888888888888888
But a second consideration struck me,0.0,0.0
Jonathan Small must have felt that the peculiar appearance of his companion however much he may have top-coated him would give rise to gossip and possibly be associated with this Norwood tragedy,-0.016666666666666663,0.5333333333333333
He was quite sharp enough to see that,-0.0625,0.625
They had started from their head-quarters under cover of darkness and he would wish to get back before it was broad light,0.15416666666666667,0.33749999999999997
Now it was past three o ’ clock according to Mrs Smith when they got the boat,-0.25,0.25
It would be quite bright and people would be about in an hour or so,0.7000000000000001,0.7999999999999999
Therefore I argued they did not go very far,0.13,1.0
They paid Smith well to hold his tongue reserved his launch for the final escape and hurried to their lodgings with the treasure-box,0.0,1.0
In a couple of nights when they had time to see what view the papers took and whether there was any suspicion they would make their way under cover of darkness to some ship at Gravesend or in the Downs where no doubt they had already arranged for passages to America or the Colonies ” “ But the launch,0.0,0.0
They could not have taken that to their lodgings ” “ Quite so,0.0,0.0
I argued that the launch must be no great way off in spite of its invisibility,-0.4,0.75
I then put myself in the place of Small and looked at it as a man of his capacity would,-0.25,0.4
He would probably consider that to send back the launch or to keep it at a wharf would make pursuit easy if the police did happen to get on his track,0.21666666666666667,0.4166666666666667
How then could he conceal the launch and yet have her at hand when wanted,0.0,0.0
I wondered what I should do myself if I were in his shoes,0.0,0.0
I could only think of one way of doing it,0.0,1.0
I might land the launch over to some boat-builder or repairer with directions to make a trifling change in her,0.0,0.0
She would then be removed to his shed or yard and so be effectually concealed while at the same time I could have her at a few hours ’ notice ” “ That seems simple enough ” “ It is just these very simple things which are extremely liable to be overlooked,-0.05000000000000001,0.34107142857142864
However I determined to act on the idea,0.0,0.0
I started at once in this harmless seaman ’ s rig and inquired at all the yards down the river,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
I drew blank at fifteen but at the sixteenth—Jacobson ’ s—I learned that the Aurora had been handed over to them two days ago by a wooden-legged man with some trivial directions as to her rudder,0.0,0.0
‘ There ain ’ t naught amiss with her rudder ’ said the foreman,0.0,0.0
‘ There she lies with the red streaks ’ At that moment who should come down but Mordecai Smith the missing owner,-0.11851851851851854,0.11296296296296297
He was rather the worse for liquor,-0.4,0.6
I should not of course have known him but he bellowed out his name and the name of his launch,0.0,0.0
‘ I want her to-night at eight o ’ clock ’ said he — ‘ eight o ’ clock sharp mind for I have two gentlemen who won ’ t be kept waiting ’ They had evidently paid him well for he was very flush of money chucking shillings about to the men,0.10833333333333334,0.43333333333333335
I followed him some distance but he subsided into an ale-house so I went back to the yard and happening to pick up one of my boys on the way I stationed him as a sentry over the launch,0.0,0.0
He is to stand at water ’ s edge and wave his handkerchief to us when they start,0.0,0.0
We shall be lying off in the stream and it will be a strange thing if we do not take men treasure and all ” “ You have planned it all very neatly whether they are the right men or not ” said Jones “ but if the affair were in my hands I should have had a body of police in Jacobson ’ s Yard and arrested them when they came down ” “ Which would have been never,0.07003968253968254,0.31865079365079363
This man Small is a pretty shrewd fellow,0.0,0.7
He would send a scout on ahead and if anything made him suspicious lie snug for another week ” “ But you might have stuck to Mordecai Smith and so been led to their hiding-place ” said I,0.0,0.0
“ In that case I should have wasted my day,-0.2,0.0
I think that it is a hundred to one against Smith knowing where they live,0.13636363636363635,0.5
As long as he has liquor and good pay why should he ask questions,0.32499999999999996,0.5
They send him messages what to do,0.0,0.0
No I thought over every possible course and this is the best ” While this conversation had been proceeding we had been shooting the long series of bridges which span the Thames,0.31666666666666665,0.5666666666666668
As we passed the City the last rays of the sun were gilding the cross upon the summit of St Paul ’ s,0.0,0.03333333333333333
It was twilight before we reached the Tower,0.0,0.0
“ That is Jacobson ’ s Yard ” said Holmes pointing to a bristle of masts and rigging on the Surrey side,0.0,0.0
“ Cruise gently up and down here under cover of this string of lighters ” He took a pair of night-glasses from his pocket and gazed some time at the shore,0.022222222222222213,0.5444444444444445
“ I see my sentry at his post ” he remarked “ but no sign of a handkerchief ” “ Suppose we go down-stream a short way and lie in wait for them ” said Jones eagerly,0.0,0.3
We were all eager by this time even the policemen and stokers who had a very vague idea of what was going forward,-0.65,0.65
“ We have no right to take anything for granted ” Holmes answered,-0.14285714285714285,0.5357142857142857
“ It is certainly ten to one that they go down-stream but we can not be certain,0.10714285714285714,0.2857142857142857
From this point we can see the entrance of the yard and they can hardly see us,-0.2916666666666667,0.5416666666666666
It will be a clear night and plenty of light,0.25,0.5416666666666666
We must stay where we are,0.0,0.0
See how the folk swarm over yonder in the gaslight ” “ They are coming from work in the yard ” “ Dirty-looking rascals but I suppose every one has some little immortal spark concealed about him,-0.1875,0.5
You would not think it to look at them,0.0,0.0
There is no a priori probability about it,0.0,0.0
A strange enigma is man ” “ Some one calls him a soul concealed in an animal ” I suggested,-0.0625,0.15
“ Winwood Reade is good upon the subject ” said Holmes,0.26666666666666666,0.4666666666666667
“ He remarks that while the individual man is an insoluble puzzle in the aggregate he becomes a mathematical certainty,0.0,0.2
You can for example never foretell what any one man will do but you can say with precision what an average number will be up to,-0.15,0.39999999999999997
Individuals vary but percentages remain constant,0.0,0.3333333333333333
So says the statistician,0.0,0.0
But do I see a handkerchief,0.0,0.0
Surely there is a white flutter over yonder ” “ Yes it is your boy ” I cried,0.25,0.4444444444444444
“ I can see him plainly ” “ And there is the Aurora ” exclaimed Holmes “ and going like the devil,-0.26785714285714285,0.35714285714285715
Full speed ahead engineer,0.35,0.55
Make after that launch with the yellow light,0.2,0.35
By heaven I shall never forgive myself if she proves to have the heels of us ” She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind two or three small craft so that she had fairly got her speed up before we saw her,0.10624999999999998,0.5
Now she was flying down the stream near in to the shore going at a tremendous rate,0.09259259259259257,0.562962962962963
Jones looked gravely at her and shook his head,0.0,0.0
“ She is very fast ” he said,0.26,0.78
“ I doubt if we shall catch her ” “ We must catch her ” cried Holmes between his teeth,0.0,0.0
“ Heap it on stokers,0.0,0.0
Make her do all she can,0.0,0.0
If we burn the boat we must have them ” We were fairly after her now,0.7,0.9
The furnaces roared and the powerful engines whizzed and clanked like a great metallic heart,0.55,0.875
Her sharp steep prow cut through the river-water and sent two rolling waves to right and to left of us,0.05357142857142857,0.42857142857142855
With every throb of the engines we sprang and quivered like a living thing,0.0,0.0
One great yellow lantern in our bows threw a long flickering funnel of light in front of us,0.2875,0.46249999999999997
Right ahead a dark blur upon the water showed where the Aurora lay and the swirl of white foam behind her spoke of the pace at which she was going,-0.06607142857142859,0.4089285714285714
We flashed past barges steamers merchant-vessels in and out behind this one and round the other,-0.24375000000000002,0.43125
Voices hailed us out of the darkness but still the Aurora thundered on and still we followed close upon her track,0.0,0.0
“ Pile it on men pile it on ” cried Holmes looking down into the engine-room while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager aquiline face,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
“ Get every pound of steam you can ” “ I think we gain a little ” said Jones with his eyes on the Aurora,-0.1875,0.5
“ I am sure of it ” said I,0.5,0.8888888888888888
“ We shall be up with her in a very few minutes ” At that moment however as our evil fate would have it a tug with three barges in tow blundered in between us,-0.63,0.565
It was only by putting our helm hard down that we avoided a collision and before we could round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two hundred yards,0.010555555555555518,0.5661111111111111
She was still however well in view and the murky uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night,0.10000000000000002,0.3833333333333333
Our boilers were strained to their utmost and the frail shell vibrated and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along,0.0,0.0
We had shot through the Pool past the West India Docks down the long Deptford Reach and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs,-0.15185185185185185,0.312962962962963
The dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the dainty Aurora,0.2027777777777778,0.6666666666666666
Jones turned our search-light upon her so that we could plainly see the figures upon her deck,-0.21428571428571427,0.35714285714285715
One man sat by the stern with something black between his knees over which he stooped,-0.16666666666666666,0.43333333333333335
Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog,-0.15,0.4
The boy held the tiller while against the red glare of the furnace I could see old Smith stripped to the waist and shovelling coals for dear life,0.05,0.1
They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we were really pursuing them but now as we followed every winding and turning which they took there could no longer be any question about it,0.225,0.26666666666666666
At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them,-0.4,0.7
At Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty,0.5,0.5
I have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered career but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad flying man-hunt down the Thames,0.053240740740740755,0.5314814814814814
Steadily we drew in upon them yard by yard,0.16666666666666666,0.5
In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and clanking of their machinery,0.0,0.0
The man in the stern still crouched upon the deck and his arms were moving as though he were busy while every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the distance which still separated us,0.1,0.3
Nearer we came and nearer,0.0,0.0
Jones yelled to them to stop,0.0,0.0
We were not more than four boat ’ s lengths behind them both boats flying at a tremendous pace,-0.10555555555555557,0.7333333333333334
It was a clear reach of the river with Barking Level upon one side and the melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other,-0.01249999999999999,0.37916666666666665
At our hail the man in the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at us cursing the while in a high cracked voice,0.16,0.5399999999999999
He was a good-sized powerful man and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump upon the right side,0.1952380952380952,0.5119047619047619
At the sound of his strident angry cries there was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck,-0.04999999999999999,0.7
It straightened itself into a little black man—the smallest I have ever seen—with a great misshapen head and a shock of tangled dishevelled hair,0.14861111111111114,0.5611111111111111
Holmes had already drawn his revolver and I whipped out mine at the sight of this savage distorted creature,0.0,0.0
He was wrapped in some sort of dark ulster or blanket which left only his face exposed but that face was enough to give a man a sleepless night,-0.0375,0.475
Never have I seen features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty,0.1,0.6
His small eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light and his thick lips were writhed back from his teeth which grinned and chattered at us with a half animal fury,-0.06333333333333332,0.3483333333333334
“ Fire if he raises his hand ” said Holmes quietly,0.0,0.3333333333333333
We were within a boat ’ s-length by this time and almost within touch of our quarry,0.0,0.0
I can see the two of them now as they stood the white man with his legs far apart shrieking out curses and the unhallowed dwarf with his hideous face and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the light of our lantern,0.18666666666666668,0.4866666666666667
It was well that we had so clear a view of him,0.10000000000000002,0.3833333333333333
Even as we looked he plucked out from under his covering a short round piece of wood like a school-ruler and clapped it to his lips,-0.1,0.35
Our pistols rang out together,0.0,0.0
He whirled round threw up his arms and with a kind of choking cough fell sideways into the stream,0.19999999999999998,0.65
I caught one glimpse of his venomous menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters,-0.5,0.5
At the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder and put it hard down so that his boat made straight in for the southern bank while we shot past her stern only clearing her by a few feet,-0.08715277777777779,0.33819444444444446
We were round after her in an instant but she was already nearly at the bank,-0.03333333333333333,0.48888888888888893
It was a wild and desolate place where the moon glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land with pools of stagnant water and beds of decaying vegetation,0.0,0.4
The launch with a dull thud ran up upon the mud-bank with her bow in the air and her stern flush with the water,-0.2916666666666667,0.5
The fugitive sprang out but his stump instantly sank its whole length into the sodden soil,0.1,0.5333333333333333
In vain he struggled and writhed,0.0,0.0
Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or backwards,0.0,1.0
He yelled in impotent rage and kicked frantically into the mud with his other foot but his struggles only bored his wooden pin the deeper into the sticky bank,-0.15625,0.59375
When we brought our launch alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out and to drag him like some evil fish over our side,-0.16,0.6191666666666666
The two Smiths father and son sat sullenly in their launch but came aboard meekly enough when commanded,0.0,0.5
The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast to our stern,0.2,0.6
A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the deck,0.0,0.1
This there could be no question was the same that had contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos,0.0,0.125
There was no key but it was of considerable weight so we transferred it carefully to our own little cabin,0.08249999999999999,0.79
As we steamed slowly up-stream again we flashed our search-light in every direction but there was no sign of the Islander,-0.30000000000000004,0.39999999999999997
Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores,-0.1,0.275
“ See here ” said Holmes pointing to the wooden hatchway,0.0,0.0
“ We were hardly quick enough with our pistols ” There sure enough just behind where we had been standing stuck one of those murderous darts which we knew so well,0.08666666666666664,0.6177777777777778
It must have whizzed between us at the instant that we fired,0.0,0.6666666666666666
Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his easy fashion but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the horrible death which had passed so close to us that night,-0.17023809523809527,0.7226190476190476
Chapter XI The Great Agra Treasure Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain,0.22999999999999998,0.39
He was a sunburned reckless-eyed fellow with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features which told of a hard open-air life,-0.2916666666666667,0.5416666666666666
There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose,0.26666666666666666,0.7166666666666667
His age may have been fifty or thereabouts for his black curly hair was thickly shot with grey,-0.17222222222222225,0.3361111111111111
His face in repose was not an unpleasing one though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him as I had lately seen a terrible expression when moved to anger,-0.55,0.5750000000000001
He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap and his head sunk upon his breast while he looked with his keen twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings,0.0,0.0
It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance,-0.09999999999999998,0.35
Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humour in his eyes,0.0,0.0
“ Well Jonathan Small ” said Holmes lighting a cigar “ I am sorry that it has come to this ” “ And so am I sir ” he answered frankly,-0.375,0.7
“ I don ’ t believe that I can swing over the job,0.0,0.0
I give you my word on the book that I never raised hand against Mr Sholto,0.0,0.0
It was that little hell-hound Tonga who shot one of his cursed darts into him,-0.1875,0.5
I had no part in it sir,0.0,0.0
I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation,0.0,0.0
I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it but it was done and I could not undo it again ” “ Have a cigar ” said Holmes “ and you had best take a pull out of my flask for you are very wet,0.2275,0.44
How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope ” “ You seem to know as much about it as if you were there sir,-0.14791666666666664,0.4145833333333333
The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear,0.10000000000000002,0.3833333333333333
I knew the habits of the house pretty well and it was the time when Mr Sholto usually went down to his supper,-0.051851851851851864,0.512962962962963
I shall make no secret of the business,0.2,0.7
The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth,0.5,0.32857142857142857
Now if it had been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart,0.1875,0.4666666666666666
I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar,-0.25,0.5
But it ’ s cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto with whom I had no quarrel whatever ” “ You are under the charge of Mr Athelney Jones of Scotland Yard,-0.09583333333333334,0.4708333333333333
He is going to bring you up to my rooms and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter,0.35,0.65
You must make a clean breast of it for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you,0.3666666666666667,0.7000000000000001
I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room ” “ That he was sir,0.06666666666666665,0.45
I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window,0.0,0.5
It fairly shook me sir,0.7,0.9
I ’ d have half killed Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off,-0.18333333333333335,0.08333333333333333
That was how he came to leave his club and some of his darts too as he tells me which I dare say helped to put you on our track though how you kept on it is more than I can tell,0.5,0.5
I don ’ t feel no malice against you for it,0.0,0.0
But it does seem a queer thing ” he added with a bitter smile “ that I who have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor,0.065625,0.33854166666666663
It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the Agra treasure which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it,-0.375,0.6666666666666666
To him it brought murder to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt to me it has meant slavery for life ” At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin,-0.018750000000000003,0.453125
“ Quite a family party ” he remarked,0.0,0.0
“ I think I shall have a pull at that flask Holmes,0.0,0.0
Well I think we may all congratulate each other,-0.125,0.375
Pity we didn ’ t take the other alive but there was no choice,-0.041666666666666664,0.325
I say Holmes you must confess that you cut it rather fine,0.4166666666666667,0.5
It was all we could do to overhaul her ” “ All is well that ends well ” said Holmes,0.0,0.0
“ But I certainly did not know that the Aurora was such a clipper ” “ Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her,0.10714285714285714,0.5357142857142857
He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business ” “ Neither he did ” cried our prisoner — “ not a word,0.0,0.0
I chose his launch because I heard that she was a flier,0.0,0.0
We told him nothing but we paid him well and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel the Esmeralda at Gravesend outward bound for the Brazils ” “ Well if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him,0.3333333333333333,0.9333333333333332
If we are pretty quick in catching our men we are not so quick in condemning them ” It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture,0.42333333333333323,0.78
From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes ’ s face I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him,0.06666666666666667,0.13333333333333333
“ We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently ” said Jones “ and shall land you Dr Watson with the treasure-box,0.0,0.0
I need hardly tell you that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing this,-0.04583333333333334,0.4208333333333333
It is most irregular but of course an agreement is an agreement,0.5,0.5
I must however as a matter of duty send an inspector with you since you have so valuable a charge,0.0,0.0
You will drive no doubt ” “ Yes I shall drive ” “ It is a pity there is no key that we may make an inventory first,0.049999999999999996,0.5111111111111111
You will have to break it open,0.0,0.5
Where is the key my man ” “ At the bottom of the river ” said Small shortly,-0.08333333333333333,0.5666666666666667
“ Hum,0.0,0.0
There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble,-0.30000000000000004,0.55
We have had work enough already through you,0.0,0.5
However doctor I need not warn you to be careful,-0.1,1.0
Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street rooms,0.0,0.0
You will find us there on our way to the station ” They landed me at Vauxhall with my heavy iron box and with a bluff genial inspector as my companion,-0.2,0.5
A quarter of an hour ’ s drive brought us to Mrs Cecil Forrester ’ s,0.0,0.0
The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor,-0.09999999999999999,0.75
Mrs Cecil Forrester was out for the evening she explained and likely to be very late,-0.195,0.89
Miss Morstan however was in the drawing-room so to the drawing-room I went box in hand leaving the obliging inspector in the cab,0.0,0.0
She was seated by the open window dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist,-0.096875,0.4
The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair playing over her sweet grave face and tinting with a dull metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair,0.15555555555555556,0.49166666666666664
One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy,0.13333333333333333,0.45
At the sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet however and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks,0.2966666666666667,0.45999999999999996
“ I heard a cab drive up ” she said,0.0,0.0
“ I thought that Mrs Forrester had come back very early but I never dreamed that it might be you,0.065,0.195
What news have you brought me ” “ I have brought something better than news ” said I putting down the box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously though my heart was heavy within me,0.04814814814814814,0.42962962962962964
“ I have brought you something which is worth all the news in the world,0.3,0.1
I have brought you a fortune ” She glanced at the iron box,0.0,0.0
“ Is that the treasure then ” she asked coolly enough,0.0,0.5
“ Yes this is the great Agra treasure,0.8,0.75
Half of it is yours and half is Thaddeus Sholto ’ s,-0.16666666666666666,0.16666666666666666
You will have a couple of hundred thousand each,0.0,0.0
Think of that,0.0,0.0
An annuity of ten thousand pounds,0.0,0.0
There will be few richer young ladies in England,-0.05,0.25
Is it not glorious ” I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight and that she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations for I saw her eyebrows rise a little and she glanced at me curiously,-0.12916666666666665,0.5166666666666667
“ If I have it ” said she “ I owe it to you ” “ No no ” I answered “ not to me but to my friend Sherlock Holmes,0.0,0.0
With all the will in the world I could never have followed up a clue which has taxed even his analytical genius,0.0,0.0
As it was we very nearly lost it at the last moment ” “ Pray sit down and tell me all about it Dr Watson ” said she,-0.008518518518518528,0.29185185185185186
I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her last —Holmes ’ s new method of search the discovery of the Aurora the appearance of Athelney Jones our expedition in the evening and the wild chase down the Thames,0.020202020202020193,0.36919191919191924
She listened with parted lips and shining eyes to my recital of our adventures,0.0,0.0
When I spoke of the dart which had so narrowly missed us she turned so white that I feared that she was about to faint,-0.2333333333333333,0.4666666666666666
“ It is nothing ” she said as I hastened to pour her out some water,0.0,0.0
“ I am all right again,0.2857142857142857,0.5357142857142857
It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed my friends in such horrible peril ” “ That is all over ” I answered,-0.5,0.75
“ It was nothing,0.0,0.0
I will tell you no more gloomy details,-0.25,0.5
Let us turn to something brighter,0.0,0.0
There is the treasure,0.0,0.0
What could be brighter than that,0.0,0.0
I got leave to bring it with me thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see it ” “ It would be of the greatest interest to me ” she said,0.625,0.6666666666666666
There was no eagerness in her voice however,0.0,0.0
It had struck her doubtless that it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize which had cost so much to win,0.8,0.4
“ What a pretty box ” she said stooping over it,0.3125,1.0
“ This is Indian work I suppose ” “ Yes it is Benares metal-work ” “ And so heavy ” she exclaimed trying to raise it,-0.25,0.5
“ The box alone must be of some value,0.0,0.0
Where is the key ” “ Small threw it into the Thames ” I answered,-0.125,0.7
“ I must borrow Mrs Forrester ’ s poker ” There was in the front a thick and broad hasp wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha,-0.11875000000000002,0.39375
Under this I thrust the end of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever,-0.5,1.0
The hasp sprang open with a loud snap,0.05,0.65
With trembling fingers I flung back the lid,0.0,0.0
We both stood gazing in astonishment,0.0,0.0
The box was empty,-0.125,0.5
No wonder that it was heavy,-0.2,0.5
The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch thick all round,-0.25,0.4375
It was massive well made and solid like a chest constructed to carry things of great price but not one shred or crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it,0.26666666666666666,0.6166666666666667
It was absolutely and completely empty,0.05,0.7
“ The treasure is lost ” said Miss Morstan calmly,0.30000000000000004,0.75
As I listened to the words and realised what they meant a great shadow seemed to pass from my soul,0.8,0.75
I did not know how this Agra treasure had weighed me down until now that it was finally removed,-0.07777777777777779,0.6444444444444445
It was selfish no doubt disloyal wrong but I could realise nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us,-0.2333333333333333,0.7999999999999999
“ Thank God ” I ejaculated from my very heart,0.2,0.3
She looked at me with a quick questioning smile,0.31666666666666665,0.3
“ Why do you say that ” she asked,0.0,0.0
“ Because you are within my reach again ” I said taking her hand,0.0,0.0
She did not withdraw it,0.0,0.0
“ Because I love you Mary as truly as ever a man loved a woman,0.6,0.7
Because this treasure these riches sealed my lips,0.0,0.0
Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you,0.5,0.6
That is why I said ‘ Thank God ’ ” “ Then I say ‘ Thank God ’ too ” she whispered as I drew her to my side,0.0,0.0
Whoever had lost a treasure I knew that night that I had gained one,0.0,0.0
Chapter XII The Strange Story of Jonathan Small A very patient man was that inspector in the cab for it was a weary time before I rejoined him,-0.033333333333333326,0.2833333333333334
His face clouded over when I showed him the empty box,-0.1,0.5
“ There goes the reward ” said he gloomily,0.0,0.0
“ Where there is no money there is no pay,0.0,0.0
This night ’ s work would have been worth a tenner each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there ” “ Mr,0.3,0.1
Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man ” I said,0.375,0.75

Of course you know all about it gentlemen —a deal more than I do very like since reading is not in my line,0.35,0.4
I only know what I saw with my own eyes,0.3,1.0
Our plantation was at a place called Muttra near the border of the Northwest Provinces,0.1,0.4
Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children on their way to Agra where were the nearest troops,-0.024999999999999994,0.4

Well one fine day the crash came,0.4166666666666667,0.5
I had been away on a distant plantation and was riding slowly home in the evening when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah,-0.2,0.375
I rode down to see what it was and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson ’ s wife all cut into ribbons and half eaten by jackals and native dogs,-0.3074074074074074,0.4851851851851852
A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face quite dead with an empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in front of him,-0.12250000000000001,0.45499999999999996

Some of them pointed at me and a couple of bullets sang past my head so I broke away across the paddy-fields and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra,-0.01666666666666668,0.45

“ The city of Agra is a great place swarming with fanatics and fierce devil-worshippers of all sorts,0.8,0.75
Our handful of men were lost among the narrow winding streets,-0.2,0.4
Our leader moved across the river therefore and took up his position in the old fort at Agra,0.1,0.2
I don ’ t know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort,0.1,0.2
It is a very queer place —the queerest that ever I was in and I have been in some rum corners too,0.2,0.3
First of all it is enormous in size,0.125,0.6166666666666667
I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres,0.0,0.0
There is a modern part which took all our garrison women children stores and everything else with plenty of room over,0.2,0.3
But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter where nobody goes and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes,0.15000000000000002,0.25
It is all full of great deserted halls and winding passages and long corridors twisting in and out so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it,0.30666666666666664,0.6066666666666667
For this reason it was seldom that any one went into it though now and again a party with torches might go exploring,0.0,0.0
“ The river washes along the front of the old fort and so protects it but on the sides and behind there are many doors and these had to be guarded of course in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops,0.11666666666666665,0.38333333333333336
We were short-handed with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns,-0.14583333333333334,0.5208333333333333
It was impossible for us therefore to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates,-0.11666666666666667,0.8666666666666667
What we did was to organise a central guard-house in the middle of the fort and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives,0.0,0.08333333333333333

Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard,-0.25,0.575
As the guard was a good two hundred paces away however and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack,0.5,0.4833333333333334

The beating of drums the rattle of tomtoms and the yells and howls of the rebels drunk with opium and with bang were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbours across the stream,-0.3666666666666667,0.7999999999999999

That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box and sent it by a trusty servant who under the guise of a merchant should take it to the fort at Agra there to lie until the land is at peace,0.5,0.75
Thus if the rebels won he would have his money but if the Company conquered his jewels would be saved to him,0.0,0.0
Having thus divided his hoard he threw himself into the cause of the Sepoys since they were strong upon his borders,0.4333333333333333,0.7333333333333333

Whether Achmet the merchant lived or died was a thing as light as air to me but at the talk about the treasure my heart turned to it and I thought of what I might do in the old country with it and how my folk would stare when they saw their ne ’ er-do-well coming back with his pockets full of gold moidores,0.2125,0.3625

It was strange to me to be standing there with those two wild Punjaubees waiting for the man who was coming to his death,0.025,0.275
“ Suddenly my eye caught the glint of a shaded lantern at the other side of the moat,-0.0625,0.4375
It vanished among the mound-heaps and then appeared again coming slowly in our direction,-0.30000000000000004,0.39999999999999997
“ ‘ Here they are ’ I exclaimed,0.0,0.0
“ ‘ You will challenge him Sahib as usual ’ whispered Abdullah,-0.25,0.25
‘ Give him no cause for fear,0.0,0.0
Send us in with him and we shall do the rest while you stay here on guard,0.0,0.0
Have the lantern ready to uncover that we may be sure that it is indeed the man ’ “ The light had flickered onwards now stopping and now advancing until I could see two dark figures upon the other side of the moat,0.165,0.5727777777777777
I let them scramble down the sloping bank splash through the mire and climb half-way up to the gate before I challenged them,-0.15555555555555559,0.2888888888888889
“ ‘ Who goes there ’ said I in a subdued voice,0.0,0.0
“ ‘ Friends ’ came the answer,0.0,0.0
I uncovered my lantern and threw a flood of light upon them,0.4,0.7
The first was an enormous Sikh with a black beard which swept nearly down to his cummerbund,-0.01805555555555556,0.48888888888888893
Outside of a show I have never seen so tall a man,0.0,0.05
The other was a little fat round fellow with a great yellow turban and a bundle in his hand done up in a shawl,0.057500000000000016,0.40499999999999997
He seemed to be all in a quiver with fear for his hands twitched as if he had the ague and his head kept turning to left and right with two bright little twinkling eyes like a mouse when he ventures out from his hole,0.19955357142857144,0.4589285714285714
It gave me the chills to think of killing him but I thought of the treasure and my heart set as hard as a flint within me,-0.2916666666666667,0.5416666666666666
When he saw my white face he gave a little chirrup of joy and came running up towards me,0.2041666666666667,0.2333333333333333
“ ‘ Your protection Sahib ’ he panted — ‘ your protection for the unhappy merchant Achmet,-0.6,0.9
I have travelled across Rajpootana that I might seek the shelter of the fort at Agra,0.0,0.0
I have been robbed and beaten and abused because I have been the friend of the Company,0.0,0.0
It is a blessed night this when I am once more in safety —I and my poor possessions ’ “ ‘ What have you in the bundle ’ I asked,0.04999999999999999,0.55
“ ‘ An iron box ’ he answered ‘ which contains one or two little family matters which are of no value to others but which I should be sorry to lose,-0.34375,0.75
Yet I am not a beggar and I shall reward you young Sahib and your governor also if he will give me the shelter I ask ’ “ I could not trust myself to speak longer with the man,0.1,0.4
The more I looked at his fat frightened face the harder did it seem that we should slay him in cold blood,-0.06666666666666665,0.5
It was best to get it over,1.0,0.3
“ ‘ Take him to the main guard ’ said I,0.16666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
The two Sikhs closed in upon him on each side and the giant walked behind while they marched in through the dark gateway,-0.1625,0.55
Never was a man so compassed round with death,-0.2,0.4
I remained at the gateway with the lantern,0.0,0.0
“ I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors,-0.09999999999999998,0.7
Suddenly it ceased and I heard voices and a scuffle with the sound of blows,0.2,0.45
A moment later there came to my horror a rush of footsteps coming in my direction with the loud breathing of a running man,0.05,0.4
I turned my lantern down the long straight passage and there was the fat man running like the wind with a smear of blood across his face and close at his heels bounding like a tiger the great black-bearded Sikh with a knife flashing in his hand,0.19861111111111113,0.45972222222222225
I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant,0.0062500000000000056,0.55
He was gaining on the Sikh and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet,0.0,0.5
My heart softened to him but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter,-0.19583333333333336,0.5208333333333333
I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit,-0.25,0.25
Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him and buried his knife twice in his side,0.0,0.0
The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle but lay were he had fallen,0.0,0.0
I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall,-0.4,0.4
You see gentlemen that I am keeping my promise,0.0,0.0
I am telling you every work of the business just exactly as it happened whether it is in my favour or not ” He stopped and held out his manacled hands for the whiskey-and-water which Holmes had brewed for him,0.25,0.25
For myself I confess that I had now conceived the utmost horror of the man not only for this cold-blooded business in which he had been concerned but even more for the somewhat flippant and careless way in which he narrated it,0.1,0.825
Whatever punishment was in store for him I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me,0.0,0.0
Sherlock Holmes and Jones sat with their hands upon their knees deeply interested in the story but with the same disgust written upon their faces,0.125,0.3125
He may have observed it for there was a touch of defiance in his voice and manner as he proceeded,0.0,0.0
“ It was all very bad no doubt ” said he,-0.9099999999999998,0.8666666666666667
“ I should like to know how many fellows in my shoes would have refused a share of this loot when they knew that they would have their throats cut for their pains,0.5,0.5
Besides it was my life or his when once he was in the fort,0.0,0.0
If he had got out the whole business would come to light and I should have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not for people were not very lenient at a time like that ” “ Go on with your story ” said Holmes shortly,0.08153846153846156,0.6184615384615384
“ Well we carried him in Abdullah Akbar and I,0.0,0.0
A fine weight he was too for all that he was so short,0.20833333333333334,0.4
Mahomet Singh was left to guard the door,0.0,0.0
We took him to a place which the Sikhs had already prepared,0.0,0.0
It was some distance off where a winding passage leads to a great empty hall the brick walls of which were all crumbling to pieces,0.35000000000000003,0.625
The earth floor had sunk in at one place making a natural grave so we left Achmet the merchant there having first covered him over with loose bricks,0.06826923076923076,0.25064102564102564
This done we all went back to the treasure,0.0,0.0
“ It lay where he had dropped it when he was first attacked,0.25,0.3333333333333333
The box was the same which now lies open upon your table,0.0,0.3125
A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top,0.25,0.75
We opened it and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore,0.07083333333333335,0.5666666666666667
It was blinding to look upon them,0.0,0.0
When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them,0.0,0.0
There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water including one which has been called I believe ‘ the Great Mogul ’ and is said to be the second largest stone in existence,0.35000000000000003,0.3611111111111111
Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds and one hundred and seventy rubies some of which however were small,0.14583333333333337,0.525
There were forty carbuncles two hundred and ten sapphires sixty-one agates and a great quantity of beryls onyxes cats ’ eyes turquoises and other stones the very names of which I did not know at the time though I have become more familiar with them since,0.2916666666666667,0.4041666666666666
Besides this there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls twelve of which were set in a gold coronet,0.32083333333333336,0.525
By the way these last had been taken out of the chest and were not there when I recovered it,0.0,0.06666666666666667
“ After we had counted our treasures we put them back into the chest and carried them to the gateway to show them to Mahomet Singh,0.0,0.0
Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret,-0.05833333333333335,0.575
We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again and then to divide it equally among ourselves,0.25,0.375
There was no use dividing it at present for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them,0.0,0.25
We carried the box therefore into the same hall where we had buried the body and there under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall we made a hollow and put our treasure,0.03809523809523809,0.2488095238095238
We made careful note of the place and next day I drew four plans one for each of us and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom for we had sworn that we should each always act for all so that none might take advantage,-0.05,0.5
That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken,0.2,0.4
“ Well there ’ s no use my telling you gentlemen what came of the Indian mutiny,0.0,0.0
After Wilson took Delhi and Sir Colin relieved Lucknow the back of the business was broken,-0.2,0.2
Fresh troops came pouring in and Nana Sahib made himself scarce over the frontier,0.3,0.5
A flying column under Colonel Greathed came round to Agra and cleared the Pandies away from it,-0.2,0.4
Peace seemed to be settling upon the country and we four were beginning to hope that the time was at hand when we might safely go off with our shares of the plunder,0.5,0.5
In a moment however our hopes were shattered by our being arrested as the murderers of Achmet,0.0,0.0
“ It came about in this way,0.0,0.0
When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man,0.0,0.0
They are suspicious folk in the East however so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first,0.25,0.27777777777777773
This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight and he followed him like his shadow,0.0,0.0
He went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway,0.0,0.0
Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort and applied for admission there himself next day but could find no trace of Achmet,0.0,0.0
This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides who brought it to the ears of the commandant,-0.05,0.15
A thorough search was quickly made and the body was discovered,0.3333333333333333,0.5
Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder —three of us because we had held the gate that night and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man,0.2333333333333333,0.26666666666666666
Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India so no one had any particular interest in them,0.16666666666666666,0.3333333333333333
The murder however was clearly made out and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it,0.15714285714285714,0.47738095238095235
The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life and I was condemned to death though my sentence was afterwards commuted into the same as the others,0.0,0.125
“ It was rather a queer position that we found ourselves in then,0.0,0.0
There we were all four tied by the leg and with precious little chance of ever getting out again while we each held a secret which might have put each of us in a palace if we could only have made use of it,-0.021875000000000006,0.8
It was enough to make a man eat his heart out to have to stand the kick and the cuff of every petty jack-in-office to have rice to eat and water to drink when that gorgeous fortune was ready for him outside just waiting to be picked up,0.22499999999999998,0.4875
It might have driven me mad but I was always a pretty stubborn one so I just held on and bided my time,-0.1875,1.0
“ At last it seemed to me to have come,0.0,0.06666666666666667
I was changed from Agra to Madras and from there to Blair Island in the Andamans,0.0,0.0
There are very few white convicts at this settlement and as I had behaved well from the first I soon found myself a sort of privileged person,-0.003333333333333336,0.15444444444444444
I was given a hut in Hope Town which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet and I was left pretty much to myself,0.05,0.39999999999999997
It is a dreary fever-stricken place and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance,0.028125000000000004,0.475
There was digging and ditching and yam-planting and a dozen other things to be done so we were busy enough all day though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves,-0.053125,0.41875
Among other things I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon and picked up a smattering of his knowledge,-0.125,0.375
All the time I was on the lookout for a chance of escape but it is hundreds of miles from any other land and there is little or no wind in those seas so it was a terribly difficult job to get away,-0.2708333333333333,0.625
“ The surgeon Dr Somerton was a fast sporting young chap and the other young officers would meet in his rooms of an evening and play cards,0.06875,0.44375
The surgery where I used to make up my drugs was next to his sitting-room with a small window between us,-0.125,0.2
Often if I felt lonesome I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery and then standing there I could hear their talk and watch their play,0.0,0.0
I am fond of a hand at cards myself and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others,0.7,0.6000000000000001
There was Major Sholto Captain Morstan and Lieutenant Bromley Brown who were in command of the native troops and there was the surgeon himself and two or three prison-officials crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game,0.2104166666666667,0.5833333333333333
A very snug little party they used to make,0.0062500000000000056,0.4
“ Well there was one thing which very soon struck me and that was that the soldiers used always to lose and the civilians to win,0.5,0.35
Mind I don ’ t say that there was anything unfair but so it was,-0.5,1.0
These prison-chaps had done little else than play cards ever since they had been at the Andamans and they knew each other ’ s game to a point while the others just played to pass the time and threw their cards down anyhow,-0.2170138888888889,0.3909722222222222
Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play,0.5,0.5
Major Sholto was the hardest hit,0.0625,0.5
He used to pay in notes and gold at first but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums,0.125,0.21666666666666667
He sometimes would win for a few deals just to give him heart and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever,0.0666666666666667,0.3666666666666667
All day he would wander about as black as thunder and he took to drinking a deal more than was good for him,0.3444444444444444,0.5111111111111112
“ One night he lost even more heavily than usual,0.016666666666666663,0.4166666666666667
I was sitting in my hut when he and Captain Morstan came stumbling along on the way to their quarters,0.0,0.0
They were bosom friends those two and never far apart,-0.05,1.0
The major was raving about his losses,0.0625,0.5
“ ‘ It ’ s all up Morstan ’ he was saying as they passed my hut,0.0,0.0
‘ I shall have to send in my papers,0.0,0.0
I am a ruined man ’ “ ‘ Nonsense old chap ’ said the other slapping him upon the shoulder,0.0,0.2875
‘ I ’ ve had a nasty facer myself but— ’ That was all I could hear but it was enough to set me thinking,-0.5,0.75
“ A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach so I took the chance of speaking to him,0.03125,0.25
“ ‘ I wish to have your advice major ’ said I,0.0625,0.5
“ ‘ Well Small what is it ’ he asked taking his cheroot from his lips,-0.25,0.4
“ ‘ I wanted to ask you sir ’ said I ‘ who is the proper person to whom hidden treasure should be handed over,-0.08333333333333333,0.21666666666666667
I know where half a million worth lies and as I can not use it myself I thought perhaps the best thing that I could do would be to hand it over to the proper authorities and then perhaps they would get my sentence shortened for me ’ “ ‘ Half a million Small ’ he gasped looking hard at me to see if I was in earnest,0.060714285714285714,0.25357142857142856
“ ‘ Quite that sir —in jewels and pearls,0.0,0.0
It lies there ready for any one,0.2,0.5
And the queer thing about it is that the real owner is outlawed and can not hold property so that it belongs to the first comer ’ “ ‘ To government Small ’ he stammered — ‘ to government ’ But he said it in a halting fashion and I knew in my heart that I had got him,0.06666666666666667,0.3444444444444444
“ ‘ You think then sir that I should give the information to the Governor-General ’ said I quietly,0.0,0.3333333333333333
“ ‘ Well well you must not do anything rash or that you might repent,0.0,0.0
Let me hear all about it Small,-0.25,0.4
Give me the facts ’ “ I told him the whole story with small changes so that he could not identify the places,-0.024999999999999994,0.4
When I had finished he stood stock still and full of thought,0.35,0.55
I could see by the twitch of his lip that there was a struggle going on within him,0.0,0.0
“ ‘ This is a very important matter Small ’ he said at last,0.09000000000000001,0.4888888888888889
‘ You must not say a word to any one about it and I shall see you again soon ’ “ Two nights later he and his friend Captain Morstan came to my hut in the dead of the night with a lantern,-0.1,0.2
“ ‘ I want you just to let Captain Morstan hear that story from your own lips Small ’ said he,0.175,0.7
“ I repeated it as I had told it before,0.0,0.0
“ ‘ It rings true eh ’ said he,0.35,0.65
‘ It ’ s good enough to act upon ’ “ Captain Morstan nodded,0.35,0.55
“ ‘ Look here Small ’ said the major,-0.09375,0.45
‘ We have been talking it over my friend here and I and we have come to the conclusion that this secret of yours is hardly a government matter after all but is a private concern of your own which of course you have the power of disposing of as you think best,0.18166666666666667,0.5833333333333333
Now the question is what price would you ask for it,0.0,0.0
We might be inclined to take it up and at least look into it if we could agree as to terms ’ He tried to speak in a cool careless way but his eyes were shining with excitement and greed,-0.15,0.65
“ ‘ Why as to that gentlemen ’ I answered trying also to be cool but feeling as excited as he did ‘ there is only one bargain which a man in my position can make,0.24166666666666667,0.7999999999999999
I shall want you to help me to my freedom and to help my three companions to theirs,0.0,0.0
We shall then take you into partnership and give you a fifth share to divide between you ’ “ ‘ Hum ’ said he,0.0,0.0
‘ A fifth share,0.0,0.0
That is not very tempting ’ “ ‘ It would come to fifty thousand apiece ’ said I,-0.1,0.3
“ ‘ But how can we gain your freedom,0.0,0.0
You know very well that you ask an impossibility ’ “ ‘ Nothing of the sort ’ I answered,0.2,0.3
‘ I have thought it all out to the last detail,0.0,0.06666666666666667

There are plenty of little yachts and yawls at Calcutta or Madras which would serve our turn well,-0.1875,0.5
Do you bring one over,0.0,0.0
We shall engage to get aboard her by night and if you will drop us on any part of the Indian coast you will have done your part of the bargain ’ “ ‘ If there were only one ’ he said,0.0,1.0
“ ‘ None or all ’ I answered,0.0,0.0
‘ We have sworn it,0.0,0.0
The four of us must always act together ’ “ ‘ You see Morstan ’ said he ‘ Small is a man of his word,-0.25,0.4

‘ Yet as you say the money would save our commissions handsomely ’ “ ‘ Well Small ’ said the major ‘ we must I suppose try and meet you,0.10416666666666667,0.6333333333333333
We must first of course test the truth of your story,0.25,0.3333333333333333
Tell me where the box is hid and I shall get leave of absence and go back to India in the monthly relief-boat to inquire into the affair ’ “ ‘ Not so fast ’ said I growing colder as he got hot,0.109375,0.36250000000000004
‘ I must have the consent of my three comrades,0.0,0.0

‘ What have three black fellows to do with our agreement ’ “ ‘ Black or blue ’ said I ‘ they are in with me and we all go together ’ “ Well the matter ended by a second meeting at which Mahomet Singh Abdullah Khan and Dost Akbar were all present,-0.06666666666666667,0.19333333333333333
We talked the matter over again and at last we came to an arrangement,0.0,0.06666666666666667
We were to provide both the officers with charts of the part of the Agra fort and mark the place in the wall where the treasure was hid,0.0,0.0
Major Sholto was to go to India to test our story,0.0625,0.5
If he found the box he was to leave it there to send out a small yacht provisioned for a voyage which was to lie off Rutland Island and to which we were to make our way and finally to return to his duties,-0.125,0.7
Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence to meet us at Agra and there we were to have a final division of the treasure he taking the major ’ s share as well as his own,0.1625,0.625
All this we sealed by the most solemn oaths that the mind could think or the lips utter,0.25,0.75
I sat up all night with paper and ink and by the morning I had the two charts all ready signed with the sign of four —that is of Abdullah Akbar Mahomet and myself,0.2,0.5
“ Well gentlemen I weary you with my long story and I know that my friend Mr Jones is impatient to get me safely stowed in chokey,0.08333333333333333,0.6
I ’ ll make it as short as I can,0.0,0.3
The villain Sholto went off to India but he never came back again,0.0,0.0
Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards,0.0,0.39
His uncle had died leaving him a fortune and he had left the army yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us,0.0,0.0
Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterwards and found as we expected that the treasure was indeed gone,-0.05,0.35
The scoundrel had stolen it all without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret,-0.4,0.7
From that day I lived only for vengeance,0.0,1.0
I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night,0.0,0.0
It became an overpowering absorbing passion with me,0.2,0.95

One day when Dr Somerton was down with a fever a little Andaman Islander was picked up by a convict-gang in the woods,-0.17152777777777778,0.3944444444444445
He was sick to death and had gone to a lonely place to die,-0.40714285714285714,0.7785714285714285
I took him in hand though he was as venomous as a young snake and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk,0.29523809523809524,0.5202380952380953
He took a kind of fancy to me then and would hardly go back to his woods but was always hanging about my hut,0.3,0.45
I learned a little of his lingo from him and this made him all the fonder of me,-0.1875,0.5
“ Tonga—for that was his name—was a fine boatman and owned a big roomy canoe of his own,0.33888888888888885,0.5333333333333333
When I found that he was devoted to me and would do anything to serve me I saw my chance of escape,0.0,0.0
I talked it over with him,0.0,0.0
He was to bring his boat round on a certain night to an old wharf which was never guarded and there he was to pick me up,-0.021428571428571436,0.44285714285714284

I had always vowed vengeance and now I had my chance,0.0,0.0

I sat down in the darkness and unstrapped my wooden leg,-0.07777777777777779,0.14444444444444446

I made for the boat and in an hour we were well out at sea,0.0,0.0
Tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him his arms and his gods,0.0,0.0

At last however some three or four years ago we found ourselves in England,0.0,0.06666666666666667
I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived and I set to work to discover whether he had realised the treasure or if he still had it,-0.4,0.75
I made friends with someone who could help me —I name no names for I don ’ t want to get any one else in a hole —and I soon found that he still had the jewels,0.0,0.0
Then I tried to get at him in many ways but he was pretty sly and had always two prize-fighters besides his sons and his khitmutgar on guard over him,0.375,0.75
“ One day however I got word that he was dying,0.0,0.0
I hurried at once to the garden mad that he should slip out of my clutches like that and looking through the window I saw him lying in his bed with his sons on each side of him,-0.625,1.0

There was not a line however so I came away bitter and savage as a man could be,-0.1,0.5
Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us as it had been on the chart and I pinned it on his bosom,-0.051851851851851864,0.09629629629629631

At last however came what we had waited for so long,-0.025,0.23333333333333334
The treasure had been found,0.0,0.0
It was up at the top of the house in Mr Bartholomew Sholto ’ s chemical laboratory,0.5,0.5
I came at once and had a look at the place but I could not see how with my wooden leg I was to make my way up to it,0.0,0.0
I learned however about a trap-door in the roof and also about Mr Sholto ’ s supper-hour,0.0,0.0
It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga,0.43333333333333335,0.8333333333333334
I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist,-0.125,0.4
He could climb like a cat and he soon made his way through the roof but as ill luck would have it Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room to his cost,-0.5,1.0
Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock,0.23888888888888893,0.7999999999999999
Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope ’ s end and cursed him for a little blood-thirsty imp,-0.04375,0.7
I took the treasure-box and let it down and then slid down myself having first left the sign of the four upon the table to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them,0.09057539682539681,0.25168650793650793

All this is the truth and if I tell it to you gentlemen it is not to amuse you —for you have not done me a very good turn —but it is because I believe the best defence I can make is just to hold back nothing but let all the world know how badly I have myself been served by Major Sholto and how innocent I am of the death of his son ” “ A very remarkable account ” said Sherlock Holmes,0.3925,0.5602380952380952
