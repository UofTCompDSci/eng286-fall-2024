    "\n",
    "You'll be prompted to login with your UTORid and password.\n",

    "On your course page, you'll see a list of assessments that your instructors have set up.\n",

    "\n",
    "To submit a Jupyter notebook file to MarkUs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, go to the [University of Toronto JupyterHub](https://jupyter.utoronto.ca) and download the file you want to submit (e.g., `W01_lab.ipynb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then in MarkUs, click on the link to the assessment you want to submit to (e.g., **lab1: Lab 1**).\n",
    "\n",
    "    You'll now see the assignment page. There's some information about the assignment here, but this will likely all be repeated from your assessment handout.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Click the **Submissions** tab. This takes you to the page where you'll submit your work for the assignment. You'll see a list of files you've submitted, which starts off empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Click on the **Submit File** button on the top-right corner of the table of files. This opens a popup dialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Click on **Browse** button, and select the notebook file you downloaded in Step 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    *Tip*: if your instructor has configured the assessment to only allow you to submit a file with a particular name (useful for autograding), you'll need to make sure the name of your file matches the required filename. In the popup dialog, you can also choose to automatically rename the file you're submitting to match the required filename.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, click **Save** to submit the file!\n",
    "\n",
    "The table of submitted files should refresh, showing the file you just submitted.\n",
    "You can click on the file to preview it directly in your web browser, which lets you check whether you submitted the correct file.\n",
    "You can also download the file you submitted by clicking on the download icon next to the name of the file.\n",
