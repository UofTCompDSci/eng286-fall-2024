"Sleep To Dream"

I tell you how I feel, but you don't care
I say tell me the truth, but you don't dare
You say love is a hell you cannot bear
And I say "Give me mine back and then go there
For all I care"

I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my own hell to raise

I have never been so insulted in all my life
I could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride
First you run like a fool just to be at my side
And now you run like a fool but you just run to hide
And I can't abide

I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body, and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my own hell to raise

Don't make it a big deal, don't be so sensitive
We're not playing a game anymore
You don't have to be so defensive

Don't you plead me your case, don't bother to explain
Don't even show me your face, cause it's a crying shame
Just go back to the rock from under which you came
Take the sorrow you gave and all the stakes you claim
And don't forget the blame

I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my own hell to raise
I got my feet on the ground
And I don't go to sleep to dream
You got your head in the clouds
And you're not at all what you seem
This mind, this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways
So don't forget what I told you; don't come around, I got my own hell to raise

"Sullen Girl"

Days like this, I don't know what to do with myself
All day and all night
I wander the halls along the walls
And under my breath I say to myself
"I need fuel to take flight"

And there's too much going on
But it's calm under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion
Under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion

Is that why they call me a sullen girl, sullen girl
They don't know I used to sail the deep and tranquil sea
But he washed me 'shore
And he took my pearl
And left an empty shell of me

And there's too much going on
But it's calm under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion
Under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion
Under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion
It's calm under the waves
In the blue of my oblivion

Once my lover, now my friend
What a cruel thing to pretend
What a cunning way to condescend
Once my lover, and now my friend

Oh, you creep up like the clouds
And you set my soul at ease
Then you let your love abound
And you bring me to my knees

Oh, it's evil, babe
The way you let your grace enrapture me
When will you know I'd be insane
To ever let that dirty game recapture me

You made me a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
I've been swinging around me
'Cause I don't know when you're gonna make your move

Oh, your gaze is dangerous
And you fill your space so sweet
If I let you get too close
You'll set your spell on me

So, darlin', I just wanna say
Just in case I don't come through
I was on to every play
I just wanted you

Oh, it's so evil, my love
The way you've no reverence to my concern
So I'll be sure to stay wary of you, love
To save the pain of once my flame and twice my burn

So, I'm a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
And I've been swinging around at nothing
I don't know when you're gonna make your move

Yeah, I'm a shadowboxer, baby
I wanna be ready for what you do
And I've been swinging around me
'Cause I don't know when you'll make your move

I've been a bad, bad girl
I've been careless with a delicate man
And it's a sad, sad world
When a girl will break a boy just because she can

Don't you tell me to deny it
I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins
I've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be true
And I just don't know where I can begin

Ooh
What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Heaven, help me for the way I am
Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done
I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand
But I keep livin' this day like the next will never come

Oh, help me, but don't tell me to deny it
I've got to cleanse myself of all these lies 'til I'm good enough for him
I've got a lot to lose and I'm bettin' high, so I'm beggin' you
Before it ends just tell me where to begin

What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

Let me know the way
Before there's hell to pay
Give me room to lay the law and let me go
I've got to make a play
To make my lover stay
So, what would an angel say?
The devil wants to know

What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love
What I need is a good defense
'Cause I'm feelin' like a criminal
And I need to be redeemed
To the one I've sinned against
Because he's all I ever knew of love

"Slow Like Honey"

You moved like honey
In my dream last night
Yeah, some old fires
Were burning
You came near to me
And you endeared to me
But you couldn't
Quite discern me
Does that scare you?
I'll let you run away
But your heart
Will not oblige you
You'll remember me
Like a melody
Yeah, I'll haunt the
World inside you

And my big secret
Gonna win you over
Slow like honey
Heavy with mood

I'll let you see me
I'll covet your regard
I'll invade your demeanor
And you'll yield to me
Like a scent in the breeze
And you'll wonder
What it is about me

It's my big secret
Keeping you coming
Slow like honey
Heavy with mood

Though dreams
Can be deceiving
Like faces are to hearts
They serve for
Sweet relieving
When fantasy and reality
Lie too far apart

So I stretch myself across
Like a bridge
And I pull you to the edge
And stand there waiting
Trying to attain
The end to satisfy the story
Shall I release you?
Must I release you?
As I rise to meet my glory

But my big secret
Gonna hover over your life
Gonna keep you reaching
When I'm gone like yesterday
When I'm high like heaven
When I'm strong like music
'Cause I'm slow like honey, and
Heavy with mood

"The First Taste"

I lie in an early bed thinking late thoughts
Waiting for the black to replace my blue
I do not struggle in your web
Because it was my aim to get caught
But daddy long legs, I feel
That I'm finally growing weary
Of waiting to be consumed by you

Give me the first taste
Let it begin
Heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase
I'll let you win
But you must make the endeavor

Oh, your love give me a heart contusion
Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red
Your hungry flirt borders intrusion
And I'm building memories
On things we have not said

Full is not heavy as empty
Not nearly my love
Not nearly my love
Not nearly

Give me the first taste
Let it begin
Heaven cannot wait forever
Darling, just start the chase
I'll let you win
But you must make the endeavor

The first taste
Let it begin, heaven cannot wait forever
Start the chase, I'll let you win
But you must make the endeavor

"Never Is A Promise"

You'll never see the courage I know
Its colors' richness won't appear within your view
I'll never glow the way that you glow
Your presence dominates the judgements made on you

But as the scenery grows, I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch I see from greater heights
I understand what I am still too proud to mention to you

You'll say you understand, but you don't understand
You'll say you'd never give up seeing eye to eye
But "never" is a promise and you can't afford to lie

You'll never touch these things that I hold
The skin of my emotions lies beneath my own
You'll never feel the heat of this soul
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown to you

You'll say, "Don't fear your dreams, it's easier than it seems."
You'll say you'd never let me fall from hopes so high
But "never" is a promise and you can't afford to lie

You'll never live this life that I live
I'll never live the life that wakes me in the night
You'll never hear the message I give
You'll say it looks as though I might give up this fight

But as the scenery grows, I see in different lights
The shades and shadows undulate in my perception
My feelings swell and stretch, I see from greater heights
I realize what I am now too smart to mention to you

You'll say you understand, you'll never understand
I'll say I'll never wake up knowing how or why
I don't know what to believe in, you don't know who I am
You'll say I need appeasing when I start to cry
But "never" is a promise and I'll never need a lie

"The Child Is Gone"

Darling, give me your absence tonight
Take the shade from the canvas and leave me the white
Let me sink in the silence that echoes inside
And don't bother leaving the light on

'Cause I suddenly feel like a different person
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion
And I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion
A vacancy that just did not belong

The child is gone

Honey, help me out of this mess
I'm a stranger to myself
But don't reach for me, I'm too far away
I don't wanna talk 'cause there's nothing left to say

So my darling, give me your absence tonight
Take all of your sympathy and leave it outside
'Cause there's no kind of loving that can make this all right
I'm trying to find a place I belong

And I suddenly feel like a different person
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion
And I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion
As the darkness turns into the dawn

The child is gone
The child is gone

Pale September, I wore the time like a dress that year
The autumn days swung soft around me like cotton on my skin
But as the embers of the summer lost their breath and disappeared
My heart went cold and only hollow rhythms resounded from within
But then he rose, brilliant as the moon in full
And sank in the burrows of my keep

And all my armor falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep

He goes along just as a water lily
Gentle on the surface of his thoughts, his body floats
Unweighed down by passion or intensity
Yet unaware of the depth upon which he coasts
And he finds a home in me
For what misfortune sows, he knows my touch will reap

And all my armour falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep
All my armour falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep

All my armour falling down in a pile at my feet
And my winter giving way to warm as I'm singing him to sleep


Won't do no good to hold no séance
What's gone is gone, and you can't bring it back around
Won't do no good to hold no searchlight
You can't illuminate what time has anchored down

Honey, I've gone away
Hey, I've gone away
I've gone away

Won't do no good to sing no love song
No sound could simulate the presence of a man
Won't do no good asking no questions
Your divination should acquaint you with the plan

Oh, honey, I've gone away
Honey, I've gone away
Honey, I've gone away

My feel for you, boy
Is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want
Is to save you, honey
Or the strength to walk
Away

Won't do no good to go no distance
The space between us is as boundless as the dark
Won't do no good to throw no fist, babe
You can't intimidate me back into your arms

Because, honey, I've gone away
I've gone away
I've gone away

I've gone away
I've gone away
I've gone
Away

My feel for you, boy
Is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want
Is to save you, honey
Or the strength to walk
Away

My feel for you, boy
Is decaying in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want is to
Save you, honey, or the
Strength to walk away

Oh!
My feel for you, boy
Is decaying right in front of me
Like the carrion of a murdered prey
And all I want is to
Save you, honey, or the
Strength to walk away
