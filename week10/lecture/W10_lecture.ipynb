    "* Discuss limitations of lexicon-based approach and look at how we can overcome some of them\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we get to sentiment analysis, we need to introduce another Python data type, which arguably can be a faviourite for English majors: dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "As [Melanie Walsh explains](https://melaniewalsh.github.io/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/02-Python/11-Dictionaries.html), dictionaries are mainly differentiated from `list`s by their use of **key-value pairs**. Whereas we access items in a list by their index position, we access the **values** of items in a dictionary by their **key**."

We've been accomplishing this with Python's built-in `string.split()` for many weeks now, then doing some extra stuff like removing punctuation with regular expressions. TextBlob does it all in one fell swoop, and does a good job with it — although we get less control over the process, and I personally prefer our previous method (can you see why??). The object it returns behaves like a `list`.\n",
    "- `blob.sentences`: This returns all the sentences in a string. We've been accomplishing this with `string.split(\".\")`. This does exactly the same thing, from what I can tell; for instance, it isn't smart enough to also split on `?` or `!`, and it is just as confused by contractions like `per cent.`.
