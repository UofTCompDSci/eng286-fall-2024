    "\n",

    "- If the name is given 90% or more of the time to babies of female sex in the Name by Gender dataset, it applies the `F` label\n",
    "- If the name is given 90% of more of the time to babies of male sex in the Name by Gender dataset, it applies the `M` label\n",
    "- If the name does not meet either threshold, it applies the `A` label\n",
    "\n",
    "The code stores this data in another Python dictionary called `name2genders`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it creates a new function called `get_gender_signal()`, which returns one of five possible values:\n",
    "- `F`, `M`, or `A`, as defined above\n",
